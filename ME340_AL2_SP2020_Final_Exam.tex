\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \(G(s) = \frac{4}{(s+2)^2(s+4)}\)
    \item[(b)] \(G(s) = \frac{2(s+1)}{s(s+1)(s+2)(s+4)}\)
    \item[(c)] \(G(s) = \frac{2}{s(s+2)(s+4)}\)
    \item[(d)] \(G(s) = \frac{2}{(s+1)(s+2)(s+4)}\)

% Short Answer: G(s) = \frac{2}{s(s + 2)(s + 4)}
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (c).\\
Given a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with specific characteristics, we aim to determine its transfer function. The details and solution steps are as follows:

\textbf{System Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system has a relative degree 3 with 3 poles, hence it has no finite zeros.
    \item It has 3 poles, hence it takes the form:
    \begin{equation}
    G(s) = \frac{K}{A(s)(s + 2)(s + 4)}
    \end{equation}
    \item Since the impulse response resembles a step response with a steady state value, we conclude the system must contain a pole at zero. Therefore, the transfer function is of the form:
    \begin{equation}
    G(s) = \frac{K}{s(s + 2)(s + 4)}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Determination of \(K\)}

Using the final value theorem to determine \(K\), we have:
\begin{align}
\lim_{s \to 0} G(s) &= \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{sK}{s(s + 2)(s + 4)} \\
&= \frac{K}{8}
\end{align}
Given the steady state value of 0.25, i.e., \(\lim_{s \to 0} sG(s) = 0.25\), we find \(K = 2\).
Therefore, the transfer function of the system is:
\begin{equation}
G(s) = \frac{2}{s(s + 2)(s + 4)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Initial Value Theorem}

Consider a system with the transfer function given by
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \frac{2(s + 1)}{s^2 + 4s + 9}
\end{equation}
and denote by \(g(t)\) the unit step response with zero initial conditions. Compute the initial slope of \(g(t)\), i.e., the slope at \(t = 0+\).\\
Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in []. Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a":\\

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] 0
    \item[(b)] 1
    \item[(c)] 2
    \item[(d)] 9
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
% Short Answer: 2
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (c).\\
We first note that the derivative of \(g(t)\) is the response to the derivative of the unit step, i.e., it is equal to the response to a Dirac delta. Hence, we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}\left\{ \frac{dg(t)}{dt} \right\} = \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\} = H(s)
\end{equation}
Therefore, the answer to the question translates into computing \(h(0+)\). This can be computed via the Initial Value Theorem. This yields
\begin{equation}
\dot{g}(0+) = h(0+) = \lim_{s \to \infty} sH(s) = \lim_{s \to \infty} \frac{2s(s + 1)}{s^2 + 4s + 9} = 2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Undershoot}

Consider a system with a transfer function given by
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \frac{2}{s + 1} + \frac{\alpha}{s + 2}
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\) is a real number. Is there a range of real values for \(\alpha\) such that the system's unit step response exhibits undershoot? 

Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in []. Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a":

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \(2<\alpha<4\)
    \item[(b)] \(-4<\alpha<-2\)
    \item[(c)] \(-2<\alpha\)
    \item[(d)] \(-4<\alpha<4\)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
% Short Answer: [-4,-2]
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (b).\\
We first note that if \(\alpha > 0\), the unit step response is always positive, thus no undershoot occurs. 

To have undershoot in the unit step response, it is sufficient that a linear system have a real zero in the open Right Half Plane (RHP) -- a Non-Minimum Phase (NMP) zero. To investigate that possibility, we add the two fractions in \(H(s)\) to yield:
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \frac{2s + 4 + \alpha s + \alpha}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = (4+\alpha)\frac{\frac{2 + \alpha}{4 + \alpha}s + 1}{(s + 1)(s + 2)}
\end{equation}

Then, we have a NMP zero if and only if \(-4 < \alpha < -2\).

\subsection{Superposition Principle}

Consider a linear system with transfer function \(G(s) = \frac{4}{s+2}\). Let \(u\) denote the input and \(y\) denote the output. The response of \(G(s)\) with \(u(t) = 2\) for \(t \geq 0\), \(u(t) = 0\) for \(t < 0\), and zero initial conditions is \(y(t) = 4(1 - e^{-2t})\).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] What is the response \(y_A\) from zero initial conditions if \(u_A(t) = -1\) for \(t \geq 0\)? Provide your answer as an explicit function of \(y(t)\).
    \item[(b)] Analyze the response \(y_B(t)\) from zero initial conditions for a piecewise input:
    \[ u_B(t) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    2 & 0 \leq t < 10, \\
    4 & t \geq 10.
    \end{cases}
    \]
    Express \(y_B(t)\) as a mathematical expression in terms of \(y(t)\), using the principle of superposition and time-invariance.
\end{enumerate}

    \item[(d)] a) \(y_A = -\frac{1}{2}y\) b) \(y_B = y(t) + y(t-10)\)
\end{itemize}

% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (d).\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Note that \(u_A = -\frac{1}{2}u\). By the principle of superposition (scaling), the response due to \(u_A\) is
    \[y_A = -\frac{1}{2}y = -2(1 - e^{-2t}).\]
    
    \item[(b)] Note that \(u_B(t) = u(t) + u(t - 10)\) where \(u(t - 10)\) is the original input shifted by 10 sec. By time-invariance, the response due to \(u(t - 10)\) is given by \(y(t - 10)\). By the principle of superposition (addition), the response due to \(u_B\) is given by \(y_B(t) = y(t) + y(t - 10)\). This plot is shown below.

    \item[(d)] \(-0.2 \leq K_p \leq 1\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
% Short Answer: Range: [-0.2, 1]
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (d).\\
First, note that we must ensure that the closed-loop is stable otherwise the control will grow unbounded. The closed-loop is modeled by:
\begin{equation}
\dot{y}(t) + (0.5 + 2K_p)y(t) = 2K_pr(t)
\end{equation}
Thus, \(K_p > -0.25\) is required for stability. There are two cases to consider: (i) \(K_p \geq 0\) and (ii) \(-0.25 < K_p < 0\).

First consider the case \(K_p \geq 0\). In this case, the output starts at \(y(0) = 0\) and converges exponentially to the final value \(\bar{y} = \frac{2K_p}{0.5+2K_p}\). The error \(e(t) = r(t) - y(t)\) thus starts at \(e(0) = 1\) and converges to the following final value:
\begin{equation}
\bar{e} = 1 - \frac{2K_p}{0.5 + 2K_p} = \frac{0.5}{0.5 + 2K_p} \leq 1
\end{equation}
In other words, \(e\) achieves its largest value at \(t = 0\) and decays to a smaller value. Thus the control effort \(u(t) = K_pe(t)\) achieves its largest value at \(t = 0\). To ensure \(|u(t)| \leq 1\) it is sufficient to require \(u(0) = K_pe(0) = K_p \leq 1\).

The alternative case \(-0.25 < K_p < 0\) actually causes the error to grow from \(e(0) = 1\) to its final value. In this case, the controller is acting to degrade tracking, which would not be typical. The hint given in the problem statement is incorrect for this case. It is fine if you only considered positive gains. However, to analyze this case you can use the expression above for the final value \(\bar{e}\). Use this expression to show that \(K_p \geq -0.2\) is required to ensure \(|u(t)| \leq 1\).

Combining these results, the input satisfies \(|u(t)| \leq 1\) for all time if the gain is selected in the range \(-0.2 \leq K_p \leq 1\).

\subsection{Equilibrium}

Consider the scalar ODE
\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} = x^2-1
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Find all the equilibria
    \item[(b)] Compute the linearization of the ODE about each equilibrium and determine the stability.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}}
%Short Answer: Equilibria: [-1,1]. "At $x = 1$, the equilibrium is unstable because the derivative $f'(x) = 2$ is positive." "At $x = -1$, the equilibrium is stable because the derivative $f'(x) = -2$ is negative."
% Reasoning Steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] 


The equilibria occur where $\dot{x} = 0$. Solving the equation $x^2 - 1 = 0$, we find the equilibrium points are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.

\item[(b)] 


The linearization involves computing the derivative of $f(x) = x^2 - 1$ with respect to $x$, which is $f'(x) = 2x$. Evaluating this derivative at each equilibrium point:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For $x = 1$, $f'(1) = 2$. Since $f'(1) > 0$, the equilibrium at $x = 1$ is unstable.
    \item For $x = -1$, $f'(-1) = -2$. Since $f'(-1) < 0$, the equilibrium at $x = -1$ is stable.
\end{itemize}
Thus, the equilibrium at $x = 1$ is unstable, while the equilibrium at $x = -1$ is stable.

    \item[(b)] Compute \(e^{At}\) and use it to obtain the solution with \(y(0) = \dot{y}(0) = \ddot{y}(0) = 1\) and \(u(t) = 0\)

% Short Answer: - \textbf{For part (a):} "State-space representation is given by matrices \(A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\) and \(B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}." \\ - \textbf{For part (b):} "The matrix \(e^{At}\) is \begin{bmatrix} 1 & t & \frac{t^2}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & t \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, and the solution \(x(t)\) is \begin{bmatrix} 1+t+\frac{t^2}{2} \\ 1+t \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}."
% Reasoning Steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] To obtain a state-space representation of the form \(\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\) for this system, we define:

        x_1 &= y, \\
        x_2 &= \dot{y}, \\
        x_3 &= \ddot{y}.

    \item[(b)] To compute \(e^{At}\) and obtain the solution with initial conditions \(y(0) = \dot{y}(0) = \ddot{y}(0) = 1\) and \(u(t) = 0\), we find:

    e^{At} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & t & \frac{t^2}{2} \\ 0 & 1 & t \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    Given \(x(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}^T\), the solution \(x(t)\) is:
\begin{equation}
    x(t) = e^{At}x(0) = \begin{bmatrix}

\subsection{Casualty}

Two systems are defined by the relationships between their input and outputs as follows:

system 1: The input is \(u(t)\) and at the same instant of time the output is \(y(t) = u(t+T), T>0\)

system 2: The input is \(u(t)\) and at the same instant of time the output is \(y(t) = u(t-T), T>0\)
Are either of these systems causal?


Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in []. Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a":

\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
In system 1, the output depends only on the input \(T\) seconds in the future. Thus it is not causal. An operation of this type is called prediction.

In system 2 the output depends only on the input \(T\) seconds in the past. Thus it is causal. An operation of this type is called a time delay.

\subsection{Proving Linear Independence via Nonzero Wronskian}

Show that a sufficient condition for a set of \(n\) functions \(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n\) to be linearly independent is that the determinant 


\begin{equation}
    \begin{vmatrix}
f_1 & f_2 & \cdots & f_n \\
\frac{df_1}{dt} & \frac{df_2}{dt} & \cdots & \frac{df_n}{dt} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{d^{n-1}f_1}{dt^{n-1}} & \frac{d^{n-1}f_2}{dt^{n-1}} & \cdots & \frac{d^{n-1}f_n}{dt^{n-1}}
\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}

be nonzero. This determinant is called the Wronskian of the functions \(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n\).

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\

Assuming the \(f_i\)s are differentiable at least \(n-1\) times, let \(n-1\) derivatives of 
\begin{equation}
    c_1 f_1 + c_2 f_2 + \cdots c_n f_n = 0
\end{equation}
be formed as follows, where \(c_i\)s are unknown constants:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
c_1 \frac{d f_1}{dt} + c_2 \frac{d f_2}{dt} + \cdots + c_n \frac{d f_n}{dt} &= 0, \\
\vdots& \\
c_1 \frac{d^{n-1} f_1}{dt^{n-1}} + c_2 \frac{d^{n-1} f_2}{dt^{n-1}} + \cdots + c_n \frac{d^{n-1} f_n}{dt^{n-1}} &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
These equations may be considered as \(n\) simultaneous linear homogeneous equations in the \(n\) unknown constants \(c_1,c_2,\cdots,C_n\)(i.e., not all \(c_i\) are equal to zero) if and only if the determinant of the coefficients (the Wronskian) is equal to zero. Hence if the Wronskian is nonzero, the the only solution for \(c_1,c_2,\cdots,C_n\) is the degenerate one, \(c_1=c_2=\cdots=c_n = 0\). Clearly, this it equivalent to saying that if the Wronskian is nonzero the functions \(f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n\) are linearly independent, since the only solution to \(c_1 f_1 + c_2 f_2 + \cdots + c_n f_n = 0\) is then \(c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = \cdots = c_n = 0\). Hence a sufficient condition for the linear independence of \(f_1,f_2,\cdots,d_n\) is that the Wronskian be nonzero. This condition is not necessary; that is , there exist sets of linearly independent functions for which the Wronskian is zero.

\subsection{Linear Independence}

Show that the function \(1,t,t^2\) are linearly independent.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\

The Wronskian of these three functions is

1 & t  & t^2 \\

0 & 1  & 2t \\
0 & 0 & 2

\end{vmatrix}

Since the Wronskian is nonzero, the functions are linearly independent.

is given by \(\mathcal{L}\left[ \frac{df}{dt} \right] = sF(s)-f(0^+)\), where \(F(s) = \mathcal{L}[f(t)]\).

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Integrating by parts.
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{\substack{T \to +\infty \\ \epsilon \to 0}} \int_{\epsilon}^T \frac{df}{dt} e^{-st} dt = \lim_{\substack{T \to +\infty \\ \epsilon \to 0}} \left[ f(t) e^{-st}|_{\epsilon}^T + s \int_{\epsilon}^T f(t) e^{-st} dt\right] = -f(0^+)+s F(s)

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\

Taking the Laplace transform of this equation, ignoring terms due to initial conditions, we obtain
\begin{equation}
    s^2 Y(s) + 3sY(s) + 2Y(s) = U(s) + s U(s)

\subsection{State-Space Representation of ODEs}

Show the equation \(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = f(x, \frac{dx}{dt})\) can be equivalently described by a pair of first-order differential equations.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
We define a set of new variables: \(x_1 = x\) and \(x_2 = \frac{dx_1}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt}\).
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{d^2x_1}{dt^2} = \frac{dx_2}{dt} = f(x, \frac{dx}{dt}) = f(x_1, \frac{dx_1}{dt}) = f(x_1,x_2)

\frac{dx_1}{dt} &= x_2 \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} &= f(x_1, x_2)

Now, suppose that we want to rewrite the above system in the following new coordinates: $\bar{v}_1:=v_1$ (velocity of car 1 ) and $\bar{v}_2:=v_2-v_1$ (relative velocity of the two cars).

Correct answer is (b).\\
DC gain for $G_1(s) = G_1(s)|_{s=0} =\frac{1}{2}$ \\
DC gain for $G_2(s) = G_2(s)|_{s=0} = -3$ \\
The final value theorem computes the correct DC gain for $G_2(s)$ but not for $G_1(s)$ because the poles of $G_1(s)$ are not in LHP, hence Final Value Theorem does not apply.

\subsection{Characterization of Second-Order Systems}

\bmat{\dot{x}_1 \\ \dot{x}_1} = \bmat{1 & 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} & -\frac{\rho}{m}}\bmat{x_1 \\ x_2} +\bmat{0 \\ \frac{1}{m}}u \qquad y=\bmat{c_1 & c_2} \bmat{x_1 \\ x_2}
\]

where $m$ is the mass, $k$ is the spring constant and $\rho$ is the friction coefficient. Find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$ to guarantee that the transfer function of the resulting system has the form of the
standard 2nd-order system. Write down the expressions for the parameters $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$ in terms of $k$, $\rho$, and $m$. \\

\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
The given system can be transformed into its transfer function as follows:
\[
C(s I -A)^{-1}B=\frac{\frac{c_2}{m}s+\frac{c_1}{m}}{s^2+\frac{\rho}{m}s+\frac{k}{m}}
\]
Comparison with the transfer function of a standard 2nd-order system yields:
\[
\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2 \zeta \omega_n+\omega_n^2}=\frac{\frac{c_2}{m}s+\frac{c_1}{m}}{s^2+\frac{\rho}{m}s+\frac{k}{m}}
\]
which leads to the following result:
\[
\frac{c_2}{m}=0, \frac{c_1}{m}=\frac{k}{m} \quad \implies \quad c_1=k,c_2=0
\]
Additionally, we get the following expressions for $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$:
\[
2 \zeta \omega_n=\frac{\rho}{m}, \omega_n=\frac{k}{m} \quad \implies \quad \omega_n=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \text{  and  } \zeta=\frac{\rho}{2 \sqrt{k m}}

Suppose that you are given the following time-domain specs: $t_r \leq 0.6$, $t_s \leq 1.6$ (defined by the time system's response reach and stay within $5\%$ of steady state). Does the given system satisfy these specs? Recall that $t_r=\frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$ and $t_s=\frac{3}{\zeta \omega_n}$. \\

\noindent \textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Recall that $t_r=\frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$ and $t_s=\frac{3}{\sigma}$.
Therefore by the given specs $t_r \leq 0.6$ and $t_s \leq 1.6$  we can conclude that:
\[
\omega_n \geq 3 \text{  and  } \sigma \geq 1.875
\]
The admissible pole locations are shown in the figure below, where the blue shaded region is due to rise time constraint and red shaded region is due to the settling time constraint.

Suppose that you are given the following time-domain specs: $t_r \leq 0.6$, $t_s \leq 1.6$ (defined by the time system's response reach and stay within $5\%$ of steady state). Suppose additionally, we have overshoot: $M_p \leq \frac{1}{e^2}$. Does the given system satisfy these specs? \\
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Recall that $t_r=\frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$, $t_s=\frac{3}{\sigma}$ and $M_p =e^{-\frac{\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}}=e^{-\pi \arctan \theta}$. Therefore by the given specs $t_r \leq 0.6$, $t_s \leq 1.6$ and  $M_p \leq \frac{1}{e^2}$, we can conclude that:
\[
\omega_n \geq 3 \text{, and  } \sigma \geq 1.875 \text{, and  }  \theta \geq 42^\circ

The admissible region due to overshoot constraint is plotted as the yellow shaded area in the figure given below. Since the poles of the system are not in the yellow region, the given system does not satisfy the specs.

The poles of this system are given by $s= -\sigma \pm j \omega_d$ where $\sigma=\zeta \omega_n$ and $\omega_d=\omega_n \sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$.

Given information $t_p = 0.5$ sec and $5\%$ settling time $t_s = 1.5$ sec leads to $\omega_d=2 \pi$ and $\sigma=2$. Therefore the poles of the system are $s=-2 \pm 2 \pi $

Consider a second-order system with peak time $t_p = 0.5$ sec. and $5\%$ settling time $t_s = 1.5$ sec. Does this system satisfy rising time $t_r \leq 0.18$ sec? \\
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Recall that $t_r=\frac{1.8}{\omega_n}$. Therefore this system must have $\omega_n \geq 10$ in order to satisfy the rise time requirement. 

We know that $\omega_n^2 =\sigma^2 +\omega_d^2$. Given that $t_p = 0.5$ sec and $5\%$ settling time $t_s = 1.5$ sec, we can compute the corresponding $\omega_d=2 \pi$ and $\sigma=2$. 

Therefore this system's $\omega_n^2 = 2^2 + (2 \pi)^2 =68$. Since $\omega_n^2 < 100$, therefore this system can't satisfy $t_r \leq 0.18$ sec.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\  
% Short Answer: No valid range
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (d).\\
The closed-loop characteristic polynomial is given by the numerator of \(1 + G(s)C(s)\), i.e.,
\begin{equation}
p(s) = s^3 + (3 + K)s^2 - (K + 4)s - 2K
\end{equation}
On applying the Routh criterion, we observe that \(p(s)\) has all its roots in the open Left Half Plane (LHP) if and only if the following three conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
\begin{equation}
3 + K > 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K^2 + 5K + 12 < 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
-2K > 0
\end{equation}
The first and third conditions require that \(-3 < K < 0\). On the other hand, the second condition can be re-written as \((K + 2.5)^2 + 5.75 < 0\). This form allows us to see that the condition cannot be met by any real value of \(K\). In summary, there is no real value for \(K\) which stabilizes the closed loop.

\subsection{Stability Analysis using PI Controller}

Consider a plant with a nominal transfer function given by
\begin{equation}
G(s) = \frac{1}{(s - 1)^2}
\end{equation}
Prove that this system cannot be stabilized with a \(PI\) controller.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\ 
% Short Answer: NA
% Reasoning Steps:
We consider the general form of a PI controller as
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{as + b}{s}
\end{equation}
Thus, the closed-loop characteristic polynomial, \(A_{cl}(s)\), is given by
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = \text{numerator of } \{1 + G(s)C(s)\} = s^3 - 2s^2 + (1 + a)s + b
\end{equation}
Hence, there are no values for \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(A_{cl}(s)\) is strictly Hurwitz. This originates from the fact that one of the coefficients of the polynomial \(A_{cl}(s)\) is negative no matter what values we choose for \(a\) and \(b\).

\subsection{Designing Minimal Complexity Stabilizing Controller}
Consider a continuous time system with a transfer function \(G_o(s)\) defined as
\begin{equation}
G_o(s) = \frac{2}{(s - 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{2}{s^2 + s - 2}.
\end{equation}
Your task is to design a controller of minimal complexity that stabilizes the plant, ensures zero steady state error for step disturbances, and achieves a closed-loop response where natural modes decay at a rate no slower than \(e^{-3t}\).

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\ 
% Short Answer: \(C(s) = \frac{35.5s^2 + 114.5s + 90}{s^2 + 14s}\)
% Reasoning Steps:
We begin by recalling that we can choose an arbitrary set of closed loop natural frequencies if the closed loop characteristic polynomial, $A_{cl}(s)$, has degree at least equal to $2n-1$ (the degree of $A_o(s)$, the plant nominal model denominator). However, since we want to force zero steady state error at d.c., an additional degree-of-freedom is needed. We are aiming for a minimum complexity controller; hence, we choose the degree of $A_{cl}(s)$ equal to $4$.

In addition, the roots of $A_{cl}(s)$ should be to the left of $s = -3$ to ensure that the response time specification is met. Say we choose
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = (s^2 + 6s + 9)(s + 4)(s + 5) = s^4 + 15s^3 + 83s^2 + 201s + 180
\end{equation}
We can now solve the Diophantine equation
\begin{equation}
(s - 1)(s + 2) \underbrace{s(s + l_0)}_{L(s)} + 2 \underbrace{(p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0)}_{P(s)} = s^4 + 15s^3 + 83s^2 + 201s + 180
\end{equation}
where $A_o(s)$ is the plant nominal model denominator, $B_o(s)$ is the plant numerator, $L(s)$ represents the controller's pole polynomial, and $P(s)$ represents the controller's zero polynomial.
We finally obtain
\begin{equation}
P(s) = 35.5s^2 + 114.5s + 90
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
L(s) = s^2 + 14s
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{35.5s^2 + 114.5s + 90}{s^2 + 14s}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pole Assignment}

Consider a nominal model given by
\begin{equation}
G_o(s) = \frac{1}{(s + 1)^2}
\end{equation}
Further assume that we need zero steady state error at zero frequency. We want to specify a third order polynomial $A_{cl}(s)$. From our analysis of the pole assignment methodology, we know that not every third order $A_{cl}(s)$ can achieve stable closed loop. Find the family of stable third degree polynomials that yields a stable closed loop with zero steady state error at d.c. Define the closed-loop system's characteristic equation as \(A_{cl}(s) = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0\). Determine the values for the coefficients \(a_2\), \(a_1\), and \(a_0\) such that the closed-loop system is stable and achieves the required steady state error characteristics.

Select the correct option from the following choices:

    \item[(c)] $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$
    \item[(d)] $a_0 = 3$, $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}}\\
% Short Answer: "For stability and zero steady state error, the coefficients must satisfy the following conditions: \(a_2 - 2 = 0\), \(a_0 > 0\), \(a_1 > 0\), \(2a_1 - a_0 > 0\)."
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (c).\\
Define
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0
\end{equation}
Then, the degree of $L(s)$ must be one and, to satisfy the steady state requirement, it must have integration. Hence the controller has the form
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{p_1s + p_0}{s}
\end{equation}
The pole assignment equation is
\begin{equation}
A_o(s)L(s) + B_o(s)P(s) = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
s(s + 1)^2 + (p_1s + p_0) = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
s^3 + 2s^2 + (p_1 + 1)s + p_0 = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0
\end{equation}
From this we see that $a_2 = 2$ assures integration in the controller. Furthermore, since $A_{cl}(s)$ has to be stable, conditions to satisfy this requirement can be obtained using Routh's Algorithm applied to the polynomial $A_{cl}(s) = s^3 + 2s^2 + a_1s + a_0$. The algorithm yields $A_{cl}$ stable if and only if
\begin{equation}
2a_1 > a_0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
a_0 > 0
\end{equation}
Finally, the family of polynomials satisfying both, stability and integration, is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} = \{s^3 + 2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 \in \mathbb{R}^3[s] : a_0 > 0, a_1 > 0, 2a_1 - a_0 > 0\}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
% Short Answer: No
% Reasoning Steps:
Substituting the feedback into the system yields
\begin{align*}
    \dot{x} &= xy, \\
    \dot{y} &= -y + ax + by.
\end{align*}

The linearization of the system about the equilibrium point \((0,0)\) is represented by the Jacobian matrix
\[
J = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 \\
    a & b-1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The stability of the equilibrium is determined by the eigenvalues of \(J\), which are solutions to the characteristic equation
\[
\det(J - \lambda I) = 0,
\]
resulting in eigenvalues \(\lambda_1 = 0\) and \(\lambda_2 = b-1\).

For asymptotic stability, all eigenvalues must have strictly negative real parts. However, \(\lambda_1 = 0\) does not satisfy this criterion, indicating that the equilibrium \((0,0)\) cannot be made asymptotically stable through any choice of constants \((a,b)\).

where \(b = \frac{K(K + 1) - 6}{K}\) for the \(s^1\) row. For stability, we require \(K > 0\) and \(b > 0\). Therefore, using the condition that \(b > 0\), we obtain

    K^2 + K - 6 > 0,

Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in []. Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a":

```

```


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (c).\\
The Routh table for this equation is given below. Here the \(s^2\) row was divided by \(4\) before the \(s^1\) row was computed. The \(s^1\) row was then divided by \(2\) before the \(s^0\) was computed.
\[
\begin{array}{l|cc}
s^3 & 2 & 4  \\
s^2 & 1 & 3 \\
s^1 & -1 & 0  \\
s^0 & 3 &  \\
\end{array}
\]
Since there are two changes of sing in the first column of the Routh table, the equation above has two roots with positive real parts.

The Hurwitz determinants for this system are

\subsection{Characterisitic Equation}

Prove that a continuous system is unstable if any coefficients of the characteristic equation are zero.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
The characteristic equation may be written in the form
\begin{equation}
    (s-s_1)(s-s_2)(s-s_3)\cdots (s-s_n) = 0
\end{equation}\
where \(s-1,s_2,\cdots,s_n\) are the roots of the equation. If this equation is multiplied out, \(n\) new equations an be obtained relating the roots and the coefficients of the characteristic equation in the usual form. Thus
\begin{equation}
    a_n s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 0
\end{equation}
and the relations are 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} = - \sum_{i=1}^n s_i, \frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n} =  \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ i \neq j}}^n s_i s_j,\frac{a_{n-3}}{a_n} - \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{\substack{k=1 \\ i \neq j \neq k}}^n s_i s_j s_k, \cdots,\frac{a_0}{a_n}(-1)^n s_1 s_2 \cdots s_n
\end{equation}
The coefficients \(a_{n-1},a_{n-2},\cdots,a_0\) all have the same sign as \(a_n\) and are nonzero if all the roots \(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n\) have negative real parts. The only way any one of the coefficients can be zero is for one or more of the roots to have zero or positive real parts. In either case, the system would be unstable.

Correct answer is (b).\\
The transfer function is
\[ P(z) = \frac{2(z - 0.2)(z + 0.5)}{(z - 0.5)(z - 0.6)(z + 0.4)} \]
Since all the system poles are inside the unit circle, the system is stable.

Correct answer is (a).\\
Singular points are found by setting \(\frac{dx_1}{dt} = 0\) and \(\frac{dx_2}{dt} = 0\). The first equation is satisfied by
\[ x_2 =  n\pi, \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \]
The second is satisfied by \(x_1 = x_2\). Hence the singular points are defined by
\[ x_1 =  n\pi, \quad x_2 =  n\pi, \]

\subsection{Observer}

Consider the single-input, single-output transfer function:
$$
Y(s)=\frac{s+1}{s^2+2 s+2} U(s)
$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Find a second-order state-space model that represents this transfer function.
    \item [(b)] For this state-space model, calculate a state-feedback controller $u=-K x+r$ that places the closed-loop poles at -4 and -25.
    \item [(c)] Construct an observer to estimate $x$ based on the known inputs $u$ and observations $y$ (put the observer poles at $\{-50,-51\}$).
    \item [(d)] With the controller and observer from the previous problems in place, calculate $k_r$ such that $u=-K \hat{x}+k_r r$ yields a closed-loop system $Y / R$ with unity gain.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Recall that for a transfer function:
$$
\frac{Q(s)}{P(s)}=\frac{b_0 s^n+b_1 s^{n-1}+\cdots+b_{n-1} s+b_n}{s^n+a_1 s^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{n-1} s+a_n}
$$
the controllable canonical realization is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 \\
-a_n & -a_{n-1} & -a_{n-2} & \ldots & -a_1
\end{array}\right] \\
B & =\left[\begin{array}{llllll}
0 & 0 & \ldots & 1
\end{array}\right]^T \\
C & =\left[\begin{array}{lllll}
b_n-a_n b_0 & b_{n-1}-a_{n-1} b_0 & b_{n-2}-a_{n-2} b_0 & \ldots & b_1-a_1 b_0
\end{array}\right] \\
D & =\left[b_0\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $b_0=0$ and therefore we have that
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1 \\
-2 & -2
\end{array}\right] x+\left[\begin{array}{l}
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right] \\
& y=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
\item [(b)] If we want to place the closed loop poles at -4 and -25 , then the new denominator would be $(s+4)(s+25)=s^2+29 s+100$. Therefore, $a_0+k_1=100 \Longrightarrow k_1=100-2=98$ and $a_1+k_2=29 \Longrightarrow k_2=29-2=27$. Hence, $K=\left[\begin{array}{ll}98 & 27\end{array}\right] \Longrightarrow u=-\left[\begin{array}{ll}98 & 27\end{array}\right] x+r$.
\item [(c)] For an observer gain $L$, the observer poles are the eigenvalues of $A \quad L C$, which coincide with the eigenvalues of $A^T-C^T L^T$. Consequently to compute the observer gain in MAT$\mathrm{LAB}$, we apply the place command for $\left(A^T, C^T\right)$. It is a rule of thumb, to pick observer poles to be 2-5 times further than the controller poles. Suppose we want to place the observer poles at $\{-50,-51\}$. By using the MATLAB command
$$ L=\operatorname{place}\left(A^{\prime}, C^{\prime},[-50,-51]\right) $$
where $\left(A^T, C^T\right)$ are as above we get $L=\left[\begin{array}{ll}-2449 & 2548\end{array}\right]^T$.

\item [(d)] To obtain $k_r$, recall that $\hat{x}(t) \equiv 0$ if $\hat{x}(0) = 0$, so we can ignore the observer. The closed loop system transfer function disregards initial conditions. With full state feedback, the
closed loop transfer function is
$$\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=C [s I-(A- B K)]^{-1}B k_r$$
To set the DC gain to unity we need
$$1 = C [s I-(A- B K)]^{-1}B k_r \implies  k_r = 100$$

\end{itemize}
\clearpage

\subsection{Discrete-Time Implementation}
Consider the following plant:
$$
\dot{y}+5 y=3 u
$$
Suppose a PI controller is used with P gain $K_p$ and I gain $K_i$. Assume the closed-loop system is stable. Then what sampling time would you recommend for a discrete-time implementation? Write out $\Delta t$ as a function of $K_p$ and $K_i$. Use $u(t)=k_p e(t)+K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) d \tau$ with $e(t)=r(t)-y(t)$. \\

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Since we are using PI control, $u(t)=k_p e(t)+K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) d \tau$ with $e(t)=r(t)-y(t)$. The closed loop system can be expressed as:
$$ \ddot{y}+\left(5+3 K_p\right) \dot{y}+3 K_i y=3 K_p \dot{r}+3 K_i r . $$

\noindent Performing Laplace transform on both sides, we have the closed-loop transfer function
$$
T(s)=\frac{3 K_p s+3 K_i}{s^2+\left(5+3 K_p\right) s+3 K_i} .
$$

\noindent The poles of the closed-loop system is
$$
s_{1,2}=\frac{-\left(5+3 K_p\right) \pm \sqrt{\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i}}{2} .
$$

\noindent Now we need to consider the following two scenarios:
(i) If $\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i \geq 0, s_1$ and $s_2$ are both real, the corresponding time constant is $\tau_1=\frac{2}{\left|-\left(5+3 K_p\right)+\sqrt{\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i}\right|}, \tau_2=\frac{2}{\left(5+3 K_p\right)+\sqrt{\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i}}$. For $\tau_1$, we have
$$
\Delta t_1=\frac{1}{5 \mid\left(5+3 K_p\right)-\sqrt{\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i}},
$$

For $\tau_2$, we have
$$
\Delta t_2=\frac{1}{5\left(5+3 K_p\right)+5 \sqrt{\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i}} .
$$

\noindent Since $\Delta t_2 \leq \Delta t_1$, we can choose $\Delta t=\Delta t_2$.
(ii) If $\left(5+3 K_p\right)^2-12 K_i \geq 0, s_1$ and $s_2$ are a complex conjugate, which has same real part and hence same time constant $\tau=\frac{2}{5+3 K_p}$. In this case, we should design $\Delta t=\frac{1}{10} \frac{2}{5+3 K_p}=$ $\frac{1}{25+15 K_p}$.

                a\ddot{x}(t) + b\dot{x}(t) + cx(t) = \cos(3t) + 2\sin(4t), \quad x(0) = 0, \quad \dot{x}(0) = 0,
            \end{equation*}
            
            where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive real numbers. The system is known to have a steady-state response of the form:

            \begin{equation*}
                x_{ss}(t) = A\cos(3t - \phi_1) + B\sin(4t - \phi_2),
            \end{equation*}
            
            where \( A \), \( B \), \( \phi_1 \), and \( \phi_2 \) are constants.
            
            Determine the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) given that \( A = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{2}} \), \( B = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \), \( \phi_1 = \frac{\pi}{4} \), and \( \phi_2 = \frac{3\pi}{4} \).

Select the correct option from the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] \( b = 1 \), \( c = 12 \), and \( a = 1 \)
    \item [(b)] \( b = 12 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( a = 1 \)

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\\\
Transfer function of the system is

\begin{equation}
    G(s) = \frac{1}{as^2 + bs + c}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{align*}
    M(\omega) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{(c-a\omega^2)^2 + (b\omega)^2}}, \\
    \phi(\omega) &= -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b\omega}{c-a\omega^2}\right)
\end{align*}

The steady-state response \( x_{ss}(t) \) is given by:
\begin{align*}
x_{ss}(t) &= 1 \times M(3) \times \cos(3t + \phi(3)) + 2 \times M(4) \times \sin(4t + \phi(4)) \\
&= 1 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{(c-9a)^2 + (3b)^2}} \times \cos\left(3t - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3b}{c-9a}\right)\right) \\
&\quad + 2 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{(c-16a)^2 + (4b)^2}} \times \sin\left(4t - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4b}{c-16a}\right)\right)
\end{align*}
Given the following conditions:
\begin{align*}
    (c-9a)^2 + (3b)^2 &= 18 \\
    (c-16a)^2 + (4b)^2 &= 32 \\
    \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3b}{c-9a}\right) &= \frac{\pi}{4} \Rightarrow c-9a = 3b \\
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4b}{c-16a}\right) &= \frac{3\pi}{4} \Rightarrow c-16a = -4b
\end{align*}

Solving these equations, we find that \( b = 1 \), \( c = 12 \), and \( a = 1 \).

\subsection{Free Response}

Show that any free response \(y_a(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n c_k y_k(t)\) satisfies \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_i(\frac{d'y}{dt'}) = 0\)


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\

By the definition of a fundamental set, \(y_k(t), k=1,2,\cdots,n\), satisfies \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_i(\frac{d'y_k}{dt'}) = 0\). Substituting \(\sum_{k=1}^n c_k y_k(t)\) into this differential equation yields
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \frac{d'}{dt'} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^n c_k y_k(t) \right] = \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{k=1}^n a_i \frac{d'}{dt'}(c_k y_k(t)) = \sum_{k=1}^n c_k \left[ \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \frac{d'y_k(t)}{dt'}\right] = 0
\end{equation}
The last equality is obtained because the term in the brackets is zero for all \(k\).

\subsection{Free Response}

{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b). \\
Fundamental set for this equation is \(e^{-3t},e^{-t}\cos t,e^{-t}\sin t\). Hence the free response can be written as 
\begin{equation}
    y_a(t) = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 e^{-t}\cos t + c_3 e^{-t} \sin t
\end{equation}
The initial conditions provide the following set of algebraic equations for \(c_1,c_2,c_3\):
\begin{equation}
    y_a(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1 \quad \frac{dy_a}{dt}|_{t=0} = -2c_1 -c_2 + c_3 = 0 \quad \frac{d^2y_a}{dt^2}|_{t=0} = 4c_1 -2 c_3 = -1
\end{equation}
fro which \(c_1 = \frac{1}{2}, c_2 = \frac{1}{2}, c_3 = \frac{3}{2}\). Therefor the free response is 
\begin{equation}
    y_a(t) = \frac{1}{2}e^{-2t} + \frac{1}{2} e^{-t}\cos t + \frac{3}{2} e^{-t} \sin t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Step Response}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] \(y(t) = 1 + e^{-t}, \quad t \geq 0 \)
    \item [(b)] \(y(t) = 2 + e^{-2t}, \quad t \geq 0 \)

Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a": 

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
The Laplace transform of the output is given by \(Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\). Here 
\begin{equation}
    P(s) = \frac{2(s+1)}{s+2} \quad U(s)  =\frac{1}{s} \quad Y(s) = \frac{2(s+1)}{s(s+2)} = \frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s+2}
\end{equation}
Evaluating the inverse transform of the partial fraction expansion of \(Y(s)\) gives \(y(t) = 1 + e^{-2t}\)
\clearpage

\subsection{Steady State Response}

Prove that the steady state output of a stable system with transfer function \(P(s)\) and input \(u = A \sin(\omega t)\) is given by
\[ y_{ss} = A|P(j\omega)| \sin(\omega t + \phi) \quad \text{where} \quad  \phi = \arg P(j\omega) \]

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
The Laplace transform of the output is \(Y(s) = P(s)U(s) = P(s) \left[ \frac{A\omega}{s^2 + \omega^2} \right]\).
When this transform is expanded into partial fractions, there will be terms due to the poles of \(P(s)\) and two terms due to the poles of the input \((s = \pm j\omega)\). Since the system is stable, all time functions resulting from the poles of \(P(s)\) decay to zero as time approaches infinity. Thus, the steady state output contains only the time functions resulting from the terms in the partial fraction expansion due to the poles of the input. The Laplace transform of the steady state output is therefore
\[ Y_{ss}(s) = \frac{AP(j\omega)}{2j(s-j\omega)} + \frac{AP(-j\omega)}{-2j(s+j\omega)} \]
The inverse transform of this equation is
\[ y_{ss} = A|P(j\omega)| \left[\frac{e^{j\phi} e^{j\omega t} - e^{-j\phi} e^{-j\omega t}}{2j} \right] =  A|P(j\omega)| \sin(\omega t + \phi) \quad \text{where} \quad  \phi = \arg P(j\omega) \]

\subsection{Unit Step Response}

\[ c(t) = 1 - e^{-t}. \]
What is the delay time \(T_d\)?
Select the correct option from the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] \( -\ln{1.5}\)
    \item [(b)] \( -\ln{0.5}\)
    \item [(c)] \( \ln{0.5}\)
    \item [(d)] \( \ln{1.5}\)
\end{enumerate}

Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in [].

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
The output is given as a function of time. The final value of the output is \(\lim_{t \to \infty} c(t) = 1\). Hence \(T_d\) (at \(50\%\) of the final value) is the solution of 
\[ 0.5 = 1 - e^{-T_d}, \] 
and is equal to \(\log_e(2)\), or \(0.693\).\\
\clearpage

\subsection{Trajectory}

Show that the phase plane trajectory of the solution of the differential equation
\[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + x = 0 \]
with initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\) and \(\left.\frac{dx}{dt}\right|_{t=0} = 1\) is a circle of unit radius centered at the origin.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Letting \(x = x_1\) and \(x_2 = \frac{dx_1}{dt}\), we obtain the pair of equations:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx_1}{dt} &= x_2, \quad x_1(0) = 0 \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} &= -x_1, \quad x_2(0) = 1
\end{align*}

We eliminate time as the independent variable by writing
\[ \frac{dx_1}{dx_2} = \frac{-x_2}{x_1} \]
or
\[ x_1 dx_1 + x_2 dx_2 = 0 \]
Integrating this equation for the given initial conditions, we obtain
\[ x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 1 \]
which is the equation of a circle of unit radius centered at the origin.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
For a sinusoidal input $u(t)=A \cos (\omega t)$ an LTI system $G$ with zero initial conditions, the system output can be expressed as follows:
$$
y(t)=A|G(j \omega)| \cos (\omega t+\angle G(j \omega))
$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(1)]  We derive the transfer function as $G(s)=\frac{-7}{3 s+2}$. This gives $|G(j)|=\frac{7 \sqrt{13}}{13}$ and $\angle G(j)=\arctan \left(\frac{3}{-2}\right)=\pi-\arctan (3 / 2)=123.69^{\circ}$. The steady state output is bounded and can be readily obtained:
$$
y_{s s}(t)=6|G(j)| \cos (t+4+\angle G(j)) \approx 11.65 \cos (t+6.16)
$$
    \item [(2)] Here the transfer function is given by
        $$ G(s)=\frac{s+2}{s^2+0.1s+4} $$
and so $|G(2j)| = 10 \sqrt{2}$ and $\angle G(2j) = \frac{-\pi}{4}$. Again, the steady state output is bounded and given by:
$$y_{ss}(t)=-10\sqrt{2}\cos{\left( 2 t -\frac{\pi}{4} \right)}$$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unbounded Response}

\]
and the input $u(t) = sin(\omega t)$,  $\omega>0$. What value of $\omega$ in $u(t)$ leads to an unbounded response and why it does so? \\
Select the correct option from the following choices:
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item [(a)] Response becomes unbounded when $\omega \rightarrow \omega_n^2$, indicating an unstable pole.
    \item [(b)] Response becomes unbounded when $\omega \rightarrow \omega_n$, indicating a pole-zero cancellation.
    \item [(c)] Response becomes unbounded when $\omega \rightarrow \omega_n$, indicating a resonance condition.
    \item [(d)] Response becomes unbounded when $\omega^2 \rightarrow \omega_n$, indicating a resonance condition.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\

\[
G(s)=\frac{1}{s^2+\omega_n^2} \implies G(j \omega) =\frac{1}{(j \omega)^2 +\omega_n^2}  =\frac{1}{\omega_n^2 - \omega^2}

Correct answer is (b).\\
The step response of the given system can be interpreted as the step response of the transfer function \(G(s) = \frac{20}{0.5s+1}\), followed by the application of the effect of \(e^{-s}\), which shifts the response by 1 second.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
The DC gain of H(s) equals 1, so the left plot is immediately rejected because it corresponds to DC gain of 0.5. The right plot show the correct DC gain, but it has an initial dip which indicates the presence of a RHP zero, while H(s) has no zeros. The middle plot is consistent with a stable second-order transfer function with DC gain of 1 and with no zeros, so it is the correct one.

    \item[(b)] Ensuring that $F(0) = 1$, we set $F(s) = \frac{25}{6s+25}$. The resulting closed-loop from $r\rightarrow y$ is now $T(s)F(s) = \frac{25}{s^2+8s+25}$.

    \label{fig:loop_97}
    \caption{Standard Feedback System}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] The closed-loop should have zero steady-state error for step reference commands. Translate this into a requirement on the sensitivity $S(s)$. What does this imply about the $L(s)=G(s)K(s)$?
    \item[(b)] The closed-loop should have an error $\leq 0.1$ for reference commands $r(t) = 2\sin(\omega t)$ with $\omega \leq 10$ rad/sec. Translate this into a requirement on the sensitivity $S(s)$.
    \item[(c)] The closed-loop should have an error $\leq 0.05$ for noise $n(t)=10\sin(\omega t)$ with $\omega \geq 1000$ rad/sec. Translate this into a requirement on the complementary sensitivity $T(s)$. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Since $S(s) = \frac{1}{1+L(s)}$ and we desire that $S(0)=0$, then we must have $L(0) = +\infty$. $L(s)$ must have a pole at $s=0$.
    \item[(b)] $e(t) \rightarrow 2 |S(j \omega)| \sin(\omega t + \measuredangle S(j \omega)) \leq 0.1$ implies that $|S(j \omega)| \leq 0.05$ for $\omega \leq 10$.
    \item[(c)] $y(t) \rightarrow - 10 |T(j \omega)| \sin(\omega t + \measuredangle T(j\omega)) \leq 0.05$ implies that $|T(j \omega)| \leq 0.05/10 = 0.005$ for $\omega \geq 1000$.

\noindent The closed loop transfer function from $R$ to $Y$ is given by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] What conditions must $G_c$ satisfy to ensure that the system can track a ramp reference input with finite steady-state error?
    \item[(b)] Find a compensator that satisfies the conditions of (a). What class of disturbances d(t) will the system reject perfectly?
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] The plant transfer function $G_p$ is given by:
    \[
    G_p(s)=\frac{Y}{V}=\frac{1}{s^2+K}
    \]
Let $G=G_c(s)G_p(s)$ then with $e=r-y$, we have $ \frac{E}{R}=\frac{1}{1+G}$.


Since $r(t)=t \implies R(s)=\frac{1}{s^2}$, the steady state error is given by:
\[
e_\infty=\lim_{s \rightarrow 0} s E(s)=\lim_{s \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{s (1+G(s))}
\]
Therefore, $G_c(s)$ must have an integrator controller and we can choose a PID controller.
    \item[(b)] We can try a PID controller with $G_c(s)=K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d s$. The closed-loop transfer function $\frac{Y}{d}$ is given by:
    \[
    \frac{Y}{d}=\frac{G_p}{1+G} = \frac{s}{s^3+K_d s^2+ (K+K_p) s+K_i}
    \]
    In order to place all the poles at -1, we set $K_i=1$, $K_p=3-K$ and $K_d=3$. This PID compensator will perfectly reject DC disturbances.

Notice that the denominator of the transfer function is a monic second order polynomial in the form $p(s)=s^{2}+a_{1} s+a_{2} $


In order for the system to be stable, we need all roots of (5) to be in the OLHP. When the determinant of (5) is non-negative, that is, $a_{1}^{2}-4 a_{2} \geq 0$, we need both roots to be negative:

$$
\frac{-a_{1} \pm \sqrt{a_{1}^{2}-4 a_{2}}}{2}<0 \Rightarrow a_{1}>0,0<a_{2} \leq \frac{a_{1}^{2}}{4}
$$

When $a_{1}^{2}-4 a_{2}<0$, we need the real part of the roots to be negative:

$$
\frac{-a_{1}}{2}<0 \Rightarrow a_{1}>0, a_{2}>\frac{a_{1}^{2}}{4}
$$

Hence it can be summarized that we need both $a_{1}>0, a_{2}>0$ in order for the system to be stable. This condition can be directly obtained by using Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Substitute $a_{1}, a_{2}$ with the system parameters given, all we need is:

$$
\left\{\begin{aligned}
& b c m-a-k>0 \\
& a k+b c l-b c k m>0
\end{aligned}\right.

% Short Answer: For a decay rate as fast as \(e^{-5t}\), \(K_p = 8\) and \(K_i \geq 25\).
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (d).\\
A PI controller has a transfer function given by
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{K_ps + K_i}{s};
\end{equation}
The closed-loop characteristic polynomial, \(A_{cl}(s)\), is derived as
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = \text{numerator of } \{1 + G(s)C(s)\} = s^2 + (2 + K_p)s + K_i.
\end{equation}
To achieve a closed-loop transient response that decays as fast as \(e^{-5t}\), the controller must generate a pair of complex conjugate poles with real parts equal to \(-5\). This requirement determines the values of \(K_p\) and \(K_i\), with \(K_p\) needing to be 8 and \(K_i\) needing to be greater than or equal to 25. Therefore, the appropriate PI controller parameters are \(K_p = 8\) and \(K_i \geq 25\).

\subsection{Pole Assignment}

A plant with nominal model
\begin{equation}
G_o(s) = \frac{1}{(s + 1)^2}
\end{equation}
is in a feedback loop under control with a PI controller having transfer function
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{K_ps + K_i}{s}
\end{equation}
Determine whether this controller configuration can be used to achieve full pole placement.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\ 
The plant is of second-order, and the controller introduces an additional third pole. However, the controller only have two gains, corresponding to two numerator coefficients, which generally precludes it from being used to place all three poles effectively.

\subsection{Minimal-Order Control Design}

Consider a nominal model for a plant given by:
\begin{equation}
G_o(s) = \frac{B_o(s)}{A_o(s)}=\frac{1}{(s + 1)(s - 2)}
\end{equation}
The closed-loop characteristic polynomial is defined as:
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
Design a controller \(C(s)\) that satisfies the following conditions:\\
- Results in the given closed-loop characteristic polynomial.\\
- Has the minimum order numerator to ensure system stability.\\
- Express both the numerator and the denominator of \(C(s)\) as expanded polynomials.\\

% Short Answer: \(C(s) = \frac{272s + 296}{s^2 + 15s + 88}\)
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (b).\\
The degree of $A_{cl}(s)$ is four and the degree of $A_o(s)$ is two. Hence $L(s)$ should have a degree equal to two. Then
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0}{s^2 + \lambda_1s + \lambda_0}
\end{equation}
The corresponding pole assignment equation becomes
\begin{equation}
A_o(s)L(s) + B_o(s)P(s) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(s + 1)(s - 2)(s^2 + \lambda_1s + \lambda_0) + (p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
s^4 + (\lambda_1 - 1)s^3 + (p_2 - \lambda_1 + \lambda_0 - 2)s^2 + (p_1 - \lambda_0 - 2\lambda_1)s + (p_0 - 2\lambda_0) = s^4 + 14s^3 + 71s^2 + 154s + 120
\end{equation}
This polynomial identity leads to the equations
\begin{align}
\lambda_1 - 1 &= 14 \\
p_2 - \lambda_1 + \lambda_0 - 2 &= 71 \\
p_1 - \lambda_0 - 2\lambda_1 &= 154 \\
p_0 - 2\lambda_0 &= 120
\end{align}
The solution of these equations is
\begin{align}
\lambda_1 &= 15 \\
p_2 &= 73 + \lambda_1 - \lambda_0 = 88 - \lambda_0 \\
p_1 &= 154 + 2\lambda_1 + \lambda_0 = 184 + \lambda_0 \\
p_0 &= 120 + 2\lambda_0
\end{align}
We thus observe that there is an infinite number of solutions. Every choice of $\lambda_0$ leads to a different stabilizing controller, for example, to force integration in the controller we can choose $\lambda_0 = 0$
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{88s^2 + 184s + 120}{s^2 + 15s}
\end{equation}
In MATLAB we can solve this problem with the command line
\begin{verbatim}
>> [L,P]=paq([1 -1 -2],1,[1 14 71 154 120])
\end{verbatim}
This leads to
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{272s + 296}{s^2 + 15s + 88}
\end{equation}
This is equivalent to choosing $\lambda_0 = 88$. The algorithm in \texttt{paq.m} has been designed to yield a minimum degree $P(s)$.

\subsection{Pole Placement}

Consider a nominal model given by:
\begin{equation}
G_o(s) = \frac{3s + 1}{(s + 2)(s - 3)}
\end{equation}
The goal is to design a control law that tracks a constant reference and cancels the pole at \(s = -2\) in \(G_o(s)\). Design a suitable controller. If pole placement is required for the characteristic equation, start with a pole at \(s = -2\) and for any additional poles required, increase their magnitude sequentially (e.g., for three required poles, assign them at \(-2\), \(-3\), and \(-4\); and so forth).\\

    \item[(c)] \(C(s) = \frac{(-44s+300)}{(5s+207)}\)
    \item[(d)] \(C(s) = \frac{(-44s+300)}{s(5s+207)}\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\ 
% Short Answer: \(C(s) = \frac{-44s^2+212s + 600}{5s^2 + 207s}\)
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (a).\\
The minimum degree of $A_{cl}(s)$ is four since we need to force integration in the controller, then
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0}{s(s + \lambda_1)}
\end{equation}
Since $(s + 2)$ is cancelled if and only if $(s + 2)$ is a factor of $A_{cl}(s)$, we choose
\begin{equation}
A_{cl}(s) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
The pole assignment equation then becomes
\begin{equation}
A_o(s)L(s) + B_o(s)P(s) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(s + 2)(s - 3)(s + \lambda_1)s + (3s + 1)(p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0) = (s + 2)(s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
In this polynomial identity we note that $(s + 2)$ has to be a factor of $P(s)$ (a plant pole can only be cancelled by a controller zero). Thus we define
\begin{equation}
(s + 2)(\tilde{p}_1s + \tilde{p}_0) = p_2s^2 + p_1s + p_0
\end{equation}
The pole assignment equation then simplifies as follows:
\begin{equation}
(s - 3)(s + \lambda_1)s + (3s + 1)(\tilde{p}_1s + \tilde{p}_0) = (s + 3)(s + 4)(s + 5)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
s^3 + (3\tilde{p}_1 + \lambda_1 - 3)s^2 + (\tilde{p}_1 + 3\tilde{p}_0 - 3\lambda_1)s + \tilde{p}_0 = s^3 + 12s^2 + 47s + 60
\end{equation}
This leads to equations
\begin{align}
3\tilde{p}_1 + \lambda_1 - 3 &= 12 \\
\tilde{p}_1 + 3\tilde{p}_0 - 3\lambda_1 &= 47 \\
\tilde{p}_0 &= 60
\end{align}
The solution is $\tilde{p}_0 = 60$, $\tilde{p}_1 = -\frac{44}{5}$ and $\lambda_1 = \frac{207}{5}$. Finally the controller is
\begin{equation}
C(s) = \frac{(s + 2)(-44s + 300)}{s(5s + 207)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{PI Controller}

Consider a car whose longitudinal motion is modeled by the following ODE:
$$2085 \dot{v}(t) + 23.2v(t) = 40u(t) + 108.4 - F_{grav}(t)$$
The input is the throttle u and the output is the velocity v. The gravitational force $F_{grav}$ is a disturbance. Let $e(t) = v_{des}- v(t)$ denote the tracking error between the desired velocity $v_{des} = 29$ m/s and actual velocity v(t). Consider a PI controller of the following form:
$$ u(t) =  \bar{u} + K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t  e(\tau) d\tau  $$
where $\bar{u}=14.11$ is the open-loop input to maintain $v_{des}$ when on 
at road $\theta= 0^\circ$ . Choose the PI gains so that the cruise control system is stable and rejects disturbances due to changing road slopes within $\approx 10$ sec. The closed-loop should also be over or critically damped as oscillations are uncomfortable for the driver. \\
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
This particular problem is of interest as it is one of the first design problems encountered by undergraduate control engineer. Moreover, it requires reasoning about the impact of the control gains on the closed-loop poles and the connection to transient response properties. There is more than one design that satisfies the given objectives.  One approach is to note that the closed-loop characteristic equation is:
\begin{align*}
 2085 s^2 + (23.2 + 40K_p) s + 40K_i =0
\end{align*}
We can place the closed-loop poles in the LHP to have any desired damping ratio $\zeta$ and natural frequency $\omega_n$ by choosing the controller gains to satisfy $\omega_n^2 = \frac{40K_i}{2085}$
and $2\zeta\omega_n = \frac{23.2+40K_p}{2085}$.  Select $\zeta=1$ to obtain two critically damped closed-loop poles placed at $s=-\omega_n$. The time constant for these poles is $\tau=\frac{1}{\omega_n}$ sec and, for critically damped poles, the 5\% settling time is approximately $4.75\tau = \frac{4.75}{\omega_n}$.  Thus we select $\omega_n = \frac{4.75}{10} = 0.475$ to obtain a settling time near 10sec.  Finally, use $\zeta=1$ and $\omega_n=0.475$ to solve for the PI gains using the relations above. This yields $K_p=48.94$ and $K_i=11.76$.  The corresponding transfer function from $F_{grav}$ to $v$ is
\begin{align*}
    T_{Fgrav \to v}(s) = \frac{-s}{2085 s^2 + 1981 s + 470.4}
\end{align*}
This has critically damped poles at $s=-0.475$ as expected. A step change increase in gravitational force (due to a step increase in the road slope) will cause the velocity to initially drop from the desired value.  However, the PI controller rejects the disturbance in $\approx 10sec$ with the velocity converging to the desired value with a nice overdamped response.

\subsection{Proportional Controller}

Consider the following first order system:
\[
\dot{y} = -0.5y + 2u \qquad  y(0) = 0

    \item[(d)] \(-1 \leq K_p \leq 1\)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (c).\\
Note that the magnitude $|u (t)|$ of the control law is directly proportional to the difference
between the state value and the reference value. i.e. $|r(t) - y(t)|$ via the gain $K_p$. Notice that the largest value of $|u(t)|$ will occur at t = 0 which gives us
\[
\max_t |u(t)| =|K_p||r(0)-y(0)|=|K_p||1-0|=|K_p|
\]
Therefore a preliminary condition for $|u(t)| \leq 1$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is that $|u\leq 1|$. However, note that we can write:
\[
\dot{y}=-0.5y +2 u= -y (0.5 + 2K_p) + 2K_p r
\]
and so when $K_p = 0$ we get a stable autonomous system with eigenvalue 0.5. On the
other hand, for any constant reference signal $r(t) \equiv$const we have that $K_p < -0.25$ will result in an unstable system. But note, that by solving for y(t) we see that further we
need,

$$|u (t)| \leq \left| K_p \left( 1- \frac{2 K_p}{0.5 + 2 K_p}\right) \right|\leq 1$$
Therefore, the acceptable range is $K_p \in [-0.2, 1]$.

Correct answer is (d).\\
For $K_p \in [-0.2, 1]$ it is clear that steady-state error to a unit-step reference input is
maximized at the left end-point of the interval and minimized at the right end-point. To
see why derive the transfer function:
\[
\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\frac{2 K_p}{s+2 K_p +0.5}
\]
and we see using Final Value Theorem that for higher $K_p$ the steady-state value approaches 1. Hence, we choose $K_p = 1$ to satisfy the constraint. The corresponding transfer function is given as follows:
\[
H(s) =\frac{2}{s+5/2} \qquad \implies \tau=\frac{2}{5}

    \item[(d)] \(K_p = 2 , K_d = 3 \)
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
We can derive the transfer function as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
H(s) =\frac{Y (s)}{R(s)} &= \frac{K_p}{s^2 + (2 - K_d )s + (K_p + 1)} \\
&= \left( \frac{K_p}{K_p+1}\right)
    \frac{K_p + 1}{s^2 + (2-K_d)s + (K_p + 1)}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
So, $\omega^2_n = K_p + 1$ and $2\zeta \omega_n = (2-K_d)$. \\
This means $K_p = \omega^2_n - 1 = 3$ and $K_d = 2-2 \times 0.25 \times 2 = 1$.

\subsection{Proportional Controller}
Consider the system 
\[
G(s)=\frac{s + 1}{s^2 + 2s + 3}
\]
is in standard feedback configuration using a controller $K$. Is it possible to make the settling time $t_s$ arbitrarily small by choosing the gain K large enough for the closed-loop system? \\
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
It is worth noting that the closed loop poles for the given system are:
\[
s =\frac{-(K + 2) \pm \sqrt{K^2 - 8}}{2}
\]
As $K \rightarrow \infty$, both of the poles for the closed loop equation are real with one of them going to $-\infty$ and at the same time the other root goes to -1. Thus, the rate limiting step is going to be -1. This limits our ability to make $t_s$ arbitrarily small. Therefore, it's not possible to make $t_s$ arbitrarily small by choosing large enough gain K.

\subsection{ Dynamic Output Feedback Controller}

Consider the following system:
\[
\dot{x}=\pmat{0 & -1 & 2/3 \\ -1 & -2 & 1 \\ 0 & -3 & 1 } x +\pmat{1 \\ 2 \\ 3}u \qquad y=x_2
\]
Design a dynamic output feedback controller such that the poles of the closed-loop system are at $-10$, $-10 \pm 5j$. \\

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
We can obtain a dynamic output feedback controller by combining state feedback controller with a full state observer design. The state-space model for the resulting controller will be:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{\hat{x}} &=(A-LC-BK)\hat{x} +L y \\
        u &=-K \hat{x}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where in order to place the poles of closed-loop system at $-10$, $-10 \pm 5j$ we need to use $K= \pmat{325 & -1251 & 735}$ and $L=\pmat{26769 & 59 & 28032}^T$ to place the observer poles at $-20$, $-20 \pm 2j$.

\subsection{Controller Design}

Suppose we would like to place a closed loop pole at $\bar{s}=-1+j$. What is the phase of $K(\bar{s})$?  \\

    \item[(d)] \(\angle K(\bar{s}) = \pi\)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution:}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
The controller needs to contribute $\pi $ rad since $\angle G(\bar{s}) +\angle K(\bar{s}) \equiv \pi$ which leads to:

\[
 \angle K(\bar{s}) = \pi - \left( 0 - 2\left( \frac{3 \pi}{4} \right) -\frac{\pi}{2}\right)= \pi +2 \pi =\pi

\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
We gave three periodic terms, so we consult the Bode plot at each frequency to determine the gain and the phase shift of each.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The frequency \(\omega = 10^{-4}\) is not included in the Bode plot, but the plot is level at \(10^{-3}\) so we assume the same gain of approximately \(60 dB\). Likewise, the phase shift is not shown, but appears to be very close to zero. Since \(60 dB = 20log(|G|) \rightarrow |G| = 10^3\), we have an output component of \(0.1 \sin(10^{-4}t)\)/
    \item At \(\omega = 10^2\), the gain is \(<-150 dB\). This gain effectiverly attenuates this signal to zero.
    \item At \(\omega = 10^4\), the gain is approximately \(0 dB\), which is a gain of \(1\). The phase shift is also effectively \(0\), so this gives a component of \(\sin(10^4t)\).
\end{itemize}
Therefore, our output is approximately: \(x(t) = 0.1 \sin(10^{-4}t) + \sin(10^4t)\).

\subsection{Lag Controller Design}


Design a lag controller that provides PM of at least \(60^{\circ}\) and steady-state tracking of constant references within \(10 \%\) for the following system
\[
G(s)=\frac{10}{\left(\frac{s}{0.2}+1\right)\left(\frac{s}{0.5}+1\right)}
\]
Compute the PM and steady-state tracking error for the following controller to verify that the specs are met:

In Fig. \ref{fig:prb23}(a), we can see that \(\mathrm{PM}=61.7 \mathrm{deg}, \omega_{c}=0.52\), and \(\mathrm{GM}=\infty\) for the system with controller $ K D(s)=0.4 \frac{s+0.05}{s+0.02}$. For steady-state error for constant input:
\[
e(\infty)=\left.\frac{1}{1+K D(s) G(s)}\right|_{s=0}=\frac{1}{1+0.4 \times 2.5 \times 10}=\frac{1}{11}<0.1

\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
According to Bode plot given below, the maximum phase (and PM in this case) achieved on $\omega\approx 1$ (rad/sec), so we need to choose K in such a way that this is also equal to $\omega_c$. The result would be therefore be $K \approx 6.3$.

\subsection{Phase Margin}
Consider the system 
\[
G(s)=\frac{1}{(s - 1)(s+1)}
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Design a PD controller that achieves phase margin $PM \approx 90^\circ$ and closed-loop bandwidth $\omega_{BW} \approx 10$. Verify that the specs are met.
    \item[(b)] Can you modify the above design to get $\omega_{BW} \approx 1$, while maintaining $PM \approx 90^\circ$? Explain how or why not.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] The bode plot of G(s) given below shows that we have a phase margin of  $PM \approx 52^\circ$ (but small $\omega_c$). We want our PD controller to increase $\omega_c$ as well as PM.

    $D(s) = K(\tau s + 1)$, we choose $\frac{1}{\tau}  \ll 10$ to make sure the gain is high enough at $\omega_c = 10$. Also, we choose $\frac{1}{\tau} < 1$ to make sure that magnitude slope at $\omega_c = 10$ is -1.

    Let $\tau=2$ and $K\left| \frac{2 j \omega_c +1}{j \omega_c (j \omega_c+1)}\right|_{\omega_c = 10} =1 \implies  K \approx 5 \implies D(s) = 5(2 s + 1)$

     \caption{Bode Plots} \label{fig:prb24}
\end{figure}


    \item[(b)] Achieving $\omega_{BW} = 1$ and $PM \approx 90^\circ$ is impossible unless we cancel the pole at $s = -1$ i.e.  $D(s) = s + 1$ . Because there is a break point at $\omega=1$ so we can't maintain slope = -1 on that point. Therefore, we cannot make $\omega_{BW} = 1$ and $PM \approx 90^\circ$ unless we take D(s) = s + 1.

\subsection{Closed-Loop Stability} 

Suppose the closed loop transfer function is given by:
\[
\frac{K L(s)}{1+ K L(s)}
\]
where K is some constant control gain.
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(1)] If L(s) has 3 LHP poles and 1 LHP zero, is the closed-loop system stable for very large values of $K > 0$ ?
    \item [(2)] If L(s) has 2 LHP poles, 1 RHP poles, and 3 LHP zeros, is the closed-loop system stable for very large values of $K > 0$?
    \item [(3)] If L(s) has 5 LHP poles, 4 LHP zeros, and 1 RHP zeroes, is the closed-loop system stable for very large values of $K > 0$ ?

Select the correct option from the following choices:

    \caption{All poles and zeros in LHP and still high gain can make a system unstable.}
    \label{fig:prb_6}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(1)] Although, all poles and zeros are in the LHP, it does not necessary mean that all values of gain, K, will keep the system stable. Suppose that the transfer function is strictly proper, then the asymptotes should be taken into consideration. If there are $j \omega$-crossings, then some asymptotes may escape into RHP with high gain, causing the system to be unstable (see Fig. \ref{fig:prb_6}). For example, consider a system with a zero at $s =-5$ and poles at $s =-2, s =-1 \pm j$. Although, it has 3 LHP poles and 1 LHP zero, the root locus plot of this system shows that there are $j \omega$-crossings and the system becomes unstable with high gain.
    \item[(2)]  Root locus branches start at the poles and end at the zeros. If the number of poles is greater than the number of zeros, then some branch(es) will go to infinity. In this case, there is one unstable pole (RHP pole). Since there are equal numbers of poles and zeros, all branches will end at the zeros and because all the zeros are in the LHP, a large enough K can stabilize the closed-loop system.
    \item[(3)] Similar to the previous problem, all branches will start at the poles and end at the zeros. This case also has equal number of both. However, one of the zeros is in the RHP. Therefore, a large value of K can cause the closed-loop system to be unstable.

    y &= 2x_1 + x_2  \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and suppose that the control objective is to minimize the performance $ \int_0^\infty [\rho y^2(t) + u^2(t)]dt \quad  \rho> 0$.
\begin{itemize}
    % \item [(a)] Show graphically the locations of the optimal closed-loop poles as the parameter $\rho$ varies (symmetric root locus).
    \item [(a)] See why in the limit as $\rho \rightarrow 0$ (“expensive control” case), the optimal closed-loop poles become mirror images of the open-loop poles across the imaginary axis.
    \item [(b)] See why in the limit as  $\rho \rightarrow \infty$(“cheap control” case), one optimal closed-loop pole cancels the open-loop zero and the other moves off to $-\infty$.

\item [(a)] open-loop poles: $1 \pm j$  from Fig. \ref{fig:prb18}, we see that for every $\rho$, we assign the LHP pole for the closed loop system (due to symmetry vs imaginary axis)

We choose a PI controller, $K(s)=\frac{K\left(s+z_c\right)}{s}$, with unity-gain feedback $H(s)=1$. The loop gain is given as: 
$$K(s) G(s)=\frac{.5 K\left(s+z_c\right)}{s(.01 s+1)(.1 s+1)}$$
The position error constant is $K_p=\infty$. Hence $\left.e_{s s}\right|_{\text {step }}=0$.
The controller zero can be selected to cancel one of the plant poles; hence $z_c=10$. Next, from the Root Locus plot given in Fig. \ref{fig:prb19}, we may choose, e.g., $K=10$. The PI controller design is given as: $$K(s)=\frac{10(s+10)}{s}$$
The closed-loop system transfer function is thus given by $T(s)=\frac{5000}{s^2+100 s+5000}$.

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
Since transient response improvement is not aimed, we may use a static controller to satisfy the damping ratio requirement. Let $K=0.7$; then, the closed-loop system has dominant roots at: $s=-0.8 \pm j 0.8(\zeta=0.7)$. The characteristic polynomial is factored as: 
$$\Delta(s)=(s+5.38)\left(s^2+1.62 s+1.3\right)$$

Next, the velocity error constant is evaluated as: $K_v=0.7$. In order to raise $K_v>10$, we consider a phase-lag controller: $K(s)=\frac{s+0.02}{s+0.0012}$, where $\angle K\left(s_1\right)=-0.3^{\circ}$. The compensated system has: $K_v=11.67$; hence $\left.e_{s s}\right|_{\text {ramp }} \leq 0.1$. The ramp response of the closed-loop system is plotted to confirm the results.

\noindent With the addition of the phase-lag controller, the closed-loop transfer function is given as:
$$
T(s)=\frac{7(s+0.02)}{(s+0.0202)(s+5.38)\left(s^2+1.61 s+1.29\right)}
$$

The closed-loop root at $s=-0.0202$ is almost canceled by the presence of the zero at $s=-0.02$. Hence, the slow mode $e^{-0.0202 t}$ has a very small coefficient and only minimally affects the system response. The dominant closed-loop roots are also minimally affected.

\subsection{Overshoot}

Consider the system

Referring to the root locus in Fig. \ref{fig:prb38}. The best location for closed-loop poles is at $-2-\sqrt{2}$, the point of multiple roots, because negative real roots means no overshoot. For large K, one pole moves right towards -2, which is not good for settling time. Thus, closed-loop characteristic equation is $(s+2+\sqrt{2})^2$ and it also equals to $s^2+(K+2)s+2(K+1)$. We finally get $K = 2 + 2+\sqrt{2}$ and the nearest integer is K = 5.\\

Correct answer is (c).\\
No, there is no non-negative value of $K$ for which the closed loop system is stable. Check the root locus given below. The root locus branch between the RHP pole and the imaginary axis zero keeps the system unstable.

\section{Nyquist Design}

\subsection{Nyquist Stability Analysis}

Consider a standard closed-loop system characterized by the loop transfer function $L(s)$. The stability of the closed-loop system can be predicted by applying the Nyquist stability criterion, which involves analyzing the Nyquist plots of $L(s)$. Below are the Nyquist plots for two different loop transfer functions, labeled as (a) and (b). Use the Nyquist stability theorem to determine the number of poles in the right-half plane (RHP) for the closed-loop system based on these plots. Then, classify each system as either stable or unstable.

\subsection{State-Feedback Controller Design and Stability Analysis}

Consider the single-input, single-output transfer function:
$$G_p(s) = \frac{1-s/2}{s^2 (1+s/2)}$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Calculate a state-feedback controller $u = - K x + r$ that places the closed loop poles at -4, -13 and -25.
    \item[(b)] Construct a stable observer and put this together to form a compensator of the form $U=-G_c Y + G_r R$.
    \item[(c)] Calculate the Nyquist plot of $G_cG_p$. Is the system stable? If so, calculate the gain and phase margins.
\end{itemize}
  

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
We can place the closed loop poles at the desired locations using the gain $K =\bmat{1300 & 477 & 40}$. Suppose we place the observer poles at -50, -51, -52 which leads to the observer gain  $$L =\bmat{ 9301 & 18450 & 29400}^T $$ The transfer functions $G_c$ and $G_r$ are thus given as follows:
\begin{align*}
    G_c &=\frac{2.207e07 s^2 + 7.979e07 s + 8.619e07}{s^3 + 193s^2 + 1.432e04s + 2.257e07} \\
    G_r &= \frac{s^3 + 153s^2 + 7802s + 1.326e05}{s^3 + 193s^2 + 1.432e04s + 2.257e07}
\end{align*}

The Nyquist plot of $G_cG_p$ is given in Fig. \ref{fig:prb_4a}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figs/8.2-1.eps}
    \caption{Nyquist Plot of $G_cG_p$}
    \label{fig:prb_4a}
\end{figure}

 The gain margin is 0.115 dB and the phase margin is -1.11 deg. We now check stability with the nyquist plot. We will use Fig. \ref{fig:prb_4b} for counting the number of windings around -1. Clearly there are 3 anticlockwise loops around -1, coloured in red, green and blue. So N must be -3. Gc has 2 RHP poles, and $G_p$ has 2 poles at origin. If the poles at origin are included as RHP poles, P = 4, else P = 2. In either case, $Z = N + P = 1/ -1$ and not zero. However, the closed loop has to be stable because we placed the poles in the LHP ourselves. 

 \begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figs/8.2-2.eps}
    \caption{Stability check}
    \label{fig:prb_4b}
\end{figure}


The problem here is that $G_c$ has a double pole at the origin. This is why the Nyquist plot
is not a closed loop, and shoots to infinity as $\omega$ approaches zero. So we need to consider a small semi-circular modified contour of radius r around the origin. Radius r is taken to be very small. There are three poles in $G_c$, two of which are in RHP and one is in LHP. There are three poles in $G_p$ as well, one in LHP and two at the origin. However, with respect to the modified contour, the two poles at the origin lie in the LHP. So they are not counted as open loop RHP poles and P = 2.

Now we need to understand how the image of the Nyquist plot changes under this modified contour. We forget the 3 anticlockwise loops already accounted for before and focus only on the part that shoots off to infinity in Fig. \ref{fig:prb_4b}. For r very small, $G_p G_c\left(j r \right) \approx  \frac{k}{(jr)^2} = - \frac{k}{r^2}$  where k is the finite limit $\lim s \rightarrow 0 s^2 G_c G_p(s)$. The point is that $G_cG_p(jr)$ will be close to the real line even though its magnitude is very large $\approx \frac{k}{r^2}$. Since the plot goes toward negative infinity, we can also say that k is negative. The semicircular contour can be parameterized as $r e^{j\theta}$ as $\theta$ goes from $ - \frac{\pi}{2} \rightarrow  - \frac{\pi}{4} \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{4} \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2}$. Since r is really small, $G_cG_p(re^{j\theta}) \approx -\frac{k}{r^2}e^{-2j\theta}$. Since $-k$ is positive, the phase of $G_cG_p(re^{j\theta})$ will be $\approx e^{-2 j \theta}$. As $\theta$ travels from $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in the anti-clockwise direction, $-2\theta$ travel from $-\pi$ back to $\pi = - \pi $ in the clockwise direction. So the Nyquist plot travels through a large clockwise circle of radius $-\frac{k}{r^2}$ when we modify the contour. This circle will wind around -1 due to its very large radius, which makes $N =-3+1=-2$. Since $P = 2$, $Z = N + P = 0$ which means the system is stable.

\subsection{Stabilizing Controllers}

Consider the following:
$$G(s) =\frac{1}{(s + 2)(s2 + 2s + 5)}$$

negative feedback loop where the forward gain is KG(s) and the loop gain is also KG(s). 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Determine what values of K stabilize the closed-loop system using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] The characteristic equation is: $s^3 + 4s^2 + 9s + 10 + K$ and the Routh table reads as follows and it yields that $-10 < K < 26$.
    \begin{table}[h!]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{c c c}
            $s^3$ &  1 & 9 \\

            $s^1$ &  $-\frac{1}{4}(K-26)$ & 0\\
            $s^0$ & K+10 & 
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}


    \item[(b)] Fig. \ref{fig:prb12} shows the Nyquist plot for this system. Let N be the number of encirclements of $\frac{-1}{K}$ and P be the number of open loop poles. We have that $N = Z - P$ where Z is the number of closed loop poles. In this particular case P = 0 yielding N = Z. This gives that
$$- \frac{1}{K}> 10 \qquad - \frac{1}{K}<0.0384$$
which is the same condition as derived using Routh-Hurwitz criterion.

\subsection{Gain/Phase Margin}

    \item[(d)] \(PM \approx 5.74\) degrees
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
Nyquist plot of KG(s) is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:prb13}. From the Nyquist plot, two points (-0.55, -1.25) intersect the negative real axis. The
corresponding gain margins are $\frac{1}{0.55} \approx 1.8$ and $\frac{1}{1.25} \approx 0.8$. The GM of the system is $[0.8,1.8]$.

To obtain PM from the Nyquist plot, draw a unit circle and mark the points where unit
circle intersects the Nyquist plot. Draw a line from the origin to one of the points. The
angle formed between that line and the $180^\circ$ axis is the PM. The Nyquist plot here
intersects the unit circle at two symmetric points, one of which is $\approx(-0.995, -0.1)$ and
so the PM is $\arctan\left( \frac{-0.1}{-0.995}\right)= 5.74$ degrees.

Correct answer is (b).\\
The Nyquist plot for the two $L(s)$ is given in Fig. \ref{fig:prb14}.The Nyquist stability theorem says that if the number of RHP poles of the closed loop transfer function $\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}$ is Z, the number of RHP poles of the open loop transfer function L(s) is P, and N is the number of clockwise rotations of the Nyquist plot around -1, then Z = N + P. Therefore,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [(a)] N = 1; P = 0 so Z = 1.

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
Writing $GH(j\omega)$ in polar form, we have
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magnitude $|GH(j\omega)| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 + 1}^3}$
    \item The phase $\angle GH(j\omega) = -3 \tan^{-1}(\omega)$
\end{itemize}
Then \(-3 \tan^{-1} \omega_\pi = -\pi, \omega_\pi = \tan(\pi/3) = \sqrt{3}\). Hence, gain margin is
\[ \frac{1}{|GH(j\omega_\pi)|} = 8\]
Also,
\[|GH(j\omega_1)| = \frac{1}{(\omega_1^2+1)^{3/2}} = 1\]
happens only at \(\omega_1  = 0\), therefore
\[\phi_{PM} = 180^\circ + (-3\tan^{-1} 0) = 180^\circ = \pi \quad  \text{radians}\]

\subsection{Bandwidth}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] 2 rad/s
    \item [(b)] 1 rad/s
    \item [(c)] \(\sqrt{2}\) rad/s
    \item [(d)]  \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) rad/s
\end{enumerate}

Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in [].

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
We have
\begin{equation}
    \left|\frac{C}{R}(j\omega)\right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2+1}}
\end{equation}
The bandwidth is the frequency at which this magnitude drops to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) of its maximum value. Since  \(|(C/R)(j\omega)|\) is a strictly decreasing function of positive frequency,  maximum happens at \(\omega = 0\). Setting the magnitude equal to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{0+1}} \) and solving for \(\omega\) yields:

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Solving this equation:

\[ \sqrt{\omega^2 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \]
\[ \omega^2 + 1 = 2 \]
\[ \omega^2 = 1 \]
\[ \omega = 1 \]
Therefore, the bandwidth of the system is \(\omega = 1\) rad/s.

\subsection{Resonance Peak}

    \item [(a)] \( M_p=\frac{1}{4} \textbf{ and } \omega_p= \sqrt{3} \)
    \item [(b)] \( M_p= \frac{5}{4} \textbf{ and } \omega_p= -\sqrt{3} \)

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (c).\\
The magnitude \(|C/R(j\omega)|\) is given by:

\[
\left| \frac{C}{R}(j\omega) \right| = \left| \frac{5}{- \omega^2 + 2j\omega + 5} \right| = \frac{5}{\sqrt{\omega^4 - 6\omega^2 + 25}}
\]

Setting the derivative of \(\left| \frac{C}{R}(j\omega) \right|\) equal to zero, we get \(\omega_p = \pm \sqrt{3}\). Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    M_P = \max_\omega \left| \frac{C}{R}(j\omega) \right| = \left| \frac{C}{R}(j\sqrt{3}) \right| = \frac{5}{4}

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
Given the open-loop transfer function \(GH(s) = \frac{432}{s(s^2 + 13s + 115)}\), we can write $GH(j\omega)$ in polar form
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magnitude $|GH(j\omega)| = \frac{432}{\sqrt{(115\omega-\omega^3)^2+(-13\omega^2)^2}}$
    \item The phase $\angle GH(j\omega) = - \tan^{-1}(\frac{115\omega - \omega^3}{-13\omega^2})$
\end{itemize}
Then \(- \tan^{-1}(\frac{115\omega_\pi - \omega_\pi^3}{-13\omega_\pi^2}) = -\pi, \omega_\pi =  \sqrt{115}\). Hence, gain margin is
\[ \frac{1}{|GH(j\omega_\pi)|} = \frac{13\times 115}{432} = 3.46\]
Also,
\[|GH(j\omega_1)| = \frac{432}{\sqrt{(115\omega_1-\omega_1^3)^2+(-13\omega_1^2)^2}} = 1\]
happens only at \(\omega_1  = 3.86\), therefore
\[\phi_{PM} = 180^\circ  - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{115\omega_1 - \omega_1^3}{-13\omega_1^2}\right) = 64^\circ \]

\subsection{Maximum Phase Lead}

Show that the maximum phase lead of the lead compensator
\begin{equation}
    P_{Lead}(j\omega) = \frac{(a/b)(1+j\omega/a)}{1+j\omega/b}
\end{equation}
occurs at \(\omega_m = \sqrt{ab}\) and find the maximum phase. What magnitude is produced at the maximum phase lead?

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
The phase angle of the lead compensator is \(\phi = \arg P_{Lead}(j\omega) = \tan^{-1} \omega/a - \tan^{-1} \omega/b\). Then
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\phi}{d\omega} = \frac{1}{a[1+(\omega/a)^2]} - \frac{1}{b[1+(\omega/b)^2]}
\end{equation}
Setting \(d\phi/d\omega\) equal to zero yields \(\omega^2 = ab\). Thus the maximum phase lead occurs at \(\omega_m = \sqrt{ab}\). Hence \(\phi_{\max} = \tan^{-1}\sqrt{b/a}-\tan^{1}\sqrt{a/b}\). But since \(\tan^{-1}\sqrt{b/a} = \pi/2-\tan^{-1}\sqrt{a/b}\), we have \(\phi_{\max} = (90 - 2\tan^{-1}\sqrt{a/b})\) degrees.

The magnitude factor is given by
\[|P_{Lead}(j\sqrt{ab})| = |\frac{(a/b)(1+j\sqrt{b/a})}{1+j\sqrt{a/b}}| = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}\]

\subsection{Gain/Phase Margin}

Suppose we have the open-loop transfer function $G(s) = \frac{K}{s(s + 20)(s + 85)}$, and we put it through unity feedback, i.e. the closed loop transfer function is $\frac{G(s)}{
1 + G(s)}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] Set the gain K so that the magnitude is 1 (0 dB) at $\omega=1$. What K achieves
this?
\item[(b)] We wish to achieve $15\%$ overshoot in the transient response for a step input. What phase
margin is required to achieve this?
\item[(c)] What frequency on the Bode phase diagram yields this phase margin?
\item[(d)] Find the adjusted gain necessary to produce the required phase margin.
\end{enumerate}


Select the correct option from the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] K=1702, Desired phase margin is $-53^\circ$, $\omega =11.2 $rad/s and adjusted gain $K^*=12010$
    \item [(b)] K=1702, Desired phase margin is $53^\circ$, $\omega =11.2 $rad/s and adjusted gain $K^*=22010$
    \item [(c)]  K=1802, Desired phase margin is $53^\circ$, $\omega =12 $rad/s and adjusted gain $K^*=22010$
    \item [(d)]  K=1702, Desired phase margin is $50^\circ$, $\omega =12 $rad/s and adjusted gain $K^*=32010$
\end{enumerate}

Please output your choice by just choosing *ONLY ONE* option from (a), (b), (c), or (d), and provide a short explanation below in JSON format by filling in the placeholders in []. Your answer should not include any further explanation, and remember to use parentheses; for example, "(a)" is correct, not "a":

{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  [(a)] For 0 $\mathrm{db}$ at $\omega=1$, we have that,
$$ |G(j 1)|=\left|\frac{K}{j(j+20)(j+85)}\right|=1 $$
so,  $K=|j(j+20)(j+85)|=\sqrt{2897626}=1702.24$
\item  [(b)] For $15 \%$ overshoot, we have that,
$$ \zeta=\frac{-\ln (0.15)}{\sqrt{\pi^2+\ln ^2(0.15)}}=0.5169 $$
using this damping ratio, we can obtain the desired phase margin
$$ \Phi_M=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \zeta}{\sqrt{-2 \zeta^2+\sqrt{1+4 \zeta^4}}}\right)=53.17^{\circ} $$

\item  [(c)] The phase which yields this phase margin is $\phi=-180+\Phi_M=-127$. The Bode plot shows the phase is -127 when $\omega=11.2 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. 
\item  [(d)] We achieve the desired phase margin by shifting the magnitude at $\omega_{\mathrm{PM}}=11.2$ to $0 \mathrm{~dB}$. This can be done by changing the gain:
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 \mathrm{~dB} & =20 \log \left|K^* G\left(j \omega_{\mathrm{PM}}\right)\right| \\
1 & =\left|K^* G\left(j \omega_{\mathrm{PM}}\right)\right|
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore $K^*=1 /\left|G\left(j \omega_{\mathrm{PM}}\right)\right|=12.93$ and the adjusted gain is $K^*=\sqrt{2897626} \times 12.93 \approx$ 22010.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase Margin}

Show that for the transfer function $K G(s)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2 \zeta \omega_n s}$, the phase margin is independent of $\omega_n$ and is given as $\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \zeta}{\sqrt{\sqrt{4 \zeta^4+1}-2 \zeta^2}}\right)$. \\
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}}\\

Given,
$$ K G(s)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2 \zeta \omega_n s} $$
To calculate the phase margin, we first find the gain-crossover-frequency $\left(\omega_c\right)$ :
\begin{align*}
\left.|K G(j \omega)|\right|_{\omega=\omega_c}=1 & \Rightarrow \frac{\omega_n^2}{\left|-\omega_c^2+2 j \omega_n \omega_c \zeta\right|}=1 \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{\omega_n^2}{\sqrt{\omega_c^4+4 \omega_n^2 \omega_c^2 \zeta^2}}=1
\end{align*}

\noindent  Therefore,
\begin{align}
\omega_n^4 & =\omega_c^4+4 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2 \omega_c^2  \nonumber  \nonumber  \\
\Leftrightarrow \omega_n^4+\left(2 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2\right)^2 & =\omega_c^4+4 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2 \omega_c^2+\left(2 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2\right)^2 \nonumber  \\
\Leftrightarrow \omega_n^4\left(1+4 \zeta^4\right) & =\left(\omega_c^2+2 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2\right)^2 \nonumber 
\end{align}

\noindent  Thus, excluding the negative root (why?),
$$
\begin{aligned}
\omega_c^2 & =-2 \zeta^2 \omega_n^2+\omega_n^2 \sqrt{4 \zeta^4+1} \nonumber  \\
& =\left(\sqrt{4 \zeta^4+1}-2 \zeta^2\right) \omega_n^2 \nonumber 
\end{aligned}
$$

\noindent  So we get,
$$ K G(j \omega)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{-\omega_c^2+2 j \zeta \omega_n \omega_c} \quad \text { and } \quad \angle K G(j \omega)=-\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \zeta \omega_n \omega_c}{-\omega_c^2}\right) $$
which is
$$ \tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \zeta}{\sqrt{\sqrt{4 \zeta^4+1}-2 \zeta^2}}\right) $$

\noindent  Note that $\theta=\tan ^{-1} x \Longleftrightarrow \pi+\theta=\tan ^{-1}(x)$.\\


If we ask for formulas, 
Claude-3 gives $PM = \pi - \arctan\left(\frac{2\zeta}{\sqrt{1 - 2\zeta^2 + \sqrt{4\zeta^4 - 4\zeta^2 + 2}}}\right)$ $=180^\circ-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \zeta (\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2+1})}{(\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2+1})^2-2 \zeta (\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2+1})}\right)$, which is close but stil wrong.

\subsection{Comparing the Contributions of Poles and Zeros in Magnitude and Phase Plots}

Consider the transfer function 
\[
G(s)=\frac{1}{(s - 1)(s+1)}
\]
The transfer function $G(j\omega)$ in this problem has an unstable real pole of the form $(j\omega \tau -1)^{-1}$ and a stable real pole of the form $(j\omega \tau + 1)^{-1}$. Compare the role of both poles and explain their contribution both to the magnitude and to the phase plot.\\ 

Select the correct option from the following choices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(a)] Magnitude for stable pole is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$ and for unstable pole $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$. For stable pole phase changes from $0^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$ while for unstable pole phase changes from $-180^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.
    \item [(b)] Magnitude for stable pole is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$ and for unstable pole $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$. For stable pole phase changes from $0^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$ while for unstable pole phase changes from $-180^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.
    \item [(c)]  Both poles have same magnitude $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$. For stable pole phase changes from $0^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$ while for unstable pole phase changes from $-180^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.
    \item [(d)]  Both poles have same magnitude $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$. For stable pole phase changes from $-180^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$ while for unstable pole phase changes from $0^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

```
{

"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

"Reason": "[Your explanation]"

}


\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (c).\\
$(j\omega \tau -1)^{-1}$ and $(j\omega \tau +1)^{-1}$ have the same magnitude $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2 +1}}$.

\noindent Before the break point $\omega=\frac{1}{\tau}$, $(j\omega \tau +1)^{-1} \approx 1$. After the break point, $(j\omega \tau +1)^{-1} \approx (j\omega \tau)^{-1}$. Therefore, its phase changes from $0^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.

\noindent The phase of unstable real pole is trickier. Before the break point $\omega=\frac{1}{\tau}$, $(j\omega \tau -1)^{-1} \approx -1$. After the break point, $(j\omega \tau +1)^{-1} \approx (j\omega \tau)^{-1}$. Therefore, its phase changes from $-180^\circ$ to $-90^\circ$.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
% Short Answer: "The minimum value of \(\eta\) is: 1."
% Reasoning Steps:
Correct answer is (d).\\
To express this in state-space form, we introduce the state vector $x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} y(t) \\ \dot{y}(t) \end{bmatrix}$, leading to
\begin{equation}
    \dot{x}(t) = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -2\delta \end{bmatrix}}_{A} x(t) 
\end{equation}
Writing \(y(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0
\end{bmatrix} x(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0

\end{bmatrix} e^{At} x_0 \), we can write \(\eta\) as follows
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \int_0^{\infty} x_0^T e^{A^Tt} \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\ 0
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} e^{At} dt = x_0^T \underbrace{\int_0^{\infty} e^{A^Tt} \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} e^{At} dt}_{P} x_0
\end{equation}

Assuming $P$ has the form
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\ p_{12} & p_{22} \end{bmatrix},
\]
we plug into the Lyapunov equation to get
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & -2\delta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\ p_{12} & p_{22} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\ p_{12} & p_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -2\delta \end{bmatrix} = -\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Solving this system of equations leads to
\begin{equation}
    P = \begin{bmatrix}
        \delta + \frac{1}{4\delta} & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{4\delta}.


    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Therefore, \(\eta = \delta + \frac{1}{4\delta}\) and the minimum happens at \(\frac{d\eta}{d\delta} = 0\), which is \(\delta = \frac{1}{2}\).

\subsection{Controllability}

Consider the second-order system
\[
\dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -a & -b \end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \end{bmatrix} u(t)
\]
and the output equation
\[
y(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} x(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix} u(t).
\]
The parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c_1\), and \(c_2\) are unknown a priori. 

For which of the following choices for \(a\), \(b\), \(c_1\) an \(c_2\) below ensure that the system is completely controllable?


\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \( (a,b,c_1,c_2) = (-4,3,1,1)\)
    \item[(b)] \( (a,b,c_1,c_2) = (10,3,0,10)\)
    \item[(c)] \( (a,b,c_1,c_2) = (3, -7/2, 1, 2)\)
    \item[(d)] \( (a,b,c_1,c_2) = (10,3,0,0)\)

```
{
"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",
"Reason": "[Your explanation]"
}
```

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\

The controllability matrix is 

\[
P_c = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\ c_2 & -ac_1 - bc_2 \end{bmatrix}
\] 
and \(\det(P_c) = c_2^2 + [bc_1]c_2 + ac_1^2\). For controllability, we require \(\det(P_c) \neq 0\), hence 
\[
c_2^2 + [bc_1]c_2 + ac_1^2 \neq 0
\] 
implies 
\[
\frac{c_2}{c_1} \neq -\frac{b}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - a}
\] 
where \(\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - a \geq 0\). For real-valued \(c_1\) and \(c_2\), if \(\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - a < 0\), all real values of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are valid. Valid values of the constants are \(c_1 = 0\), \(c_2 = 10\), \(a = 10\), and \(b = 3\). Valid values of the constants are \(c_1 = 0\), \(c_2 = 10\), \(a = 10\), and \(b = 3\).

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \(V=x_1^2+x_2^2\) , and \(a>0,d>0\) and \(b=-c\) 
    \item[(b)] \(V=x_1^2+x_2^2\) , and \(a<0,d<0\) and \(b=-c\)

```
{
"Choice": "[ONLY ONE choice from (a), (b), (c), (d)]",

}
```

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
Using the Lyapunov function
\[ V = x_1^2 + x_2^2 \]
which is positive for all \(x_1\), \(x_2\) except \(x_1 = x_2 = 0\). The time derivative of \(V\) is
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 2x_1 \frac{dx_1}{dt} + 2x_2 \frac{dx_2}{dt} = 2ax_1^2 + 2bx_1x_2 + 2cx_1x_2 + 2dx_2^2
\]
To make \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) negative for all \(x_1\), \(x_2\), we might choose \(a < 0\), \(d < 0\), and \(b = -c\). In this case,
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 2ax_1^2 + 2dx_2^2 < 0
\]
except when \(x_1 = x_2 = 0\). Hence one set of sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability are \(a < 0\), \(d < 0\), and \(b = -c\). There are other possible solutions to this problem.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (d).\\
Let \(V[x(k)] = [x_1(k)]^2\), which is greater than \(0\) for all \(x \neq 0\). Then, 
\begin{align}
    \Delta V &= x_1^2(k+1) - x_1^2(k) = (x_1(k)-f[x_1(k)])^2 -x_1^2(k) \\

To eliminate the cross-product term \(x_2 f(x_1)\), set \(c = -2\). Then,

Where \(Q = \begin{bmatrix}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (b).\\
System's transfer function is given by:
$$G(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B= \frac{s + 2 + b(s - 1)}{(s+2)(s-1)}$$
We can see that setting $b=0$ leads to pole-zero cancellation and loss of controllability in the system. Alternatively, it can also be checked by:
$$\mathcal{C}(A,B)=\pmat{1 & 1\\ b & -2b}$$
and for $b = 0$, rank$(\mathcal{C}(A, B)) = 1 <2$.

\section{Loop-Shaping}
\subsection{Loop Gain}

We plan to design a controller $K(s)$ for a system with transfer function given by $G(s)$. The controller and the system are in standard unity feedback setting. Let $e=r-y$ where $r$ and $y$ representing the reference and the output signals respectively. Let $n$ represent the output noise i.e. if $n \neq 0$ then $e=r- (y+n)$. The specifications are to design a controller so that the closed loop is stable and has:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] gain less than 0.01 from reference r to error e for frequencies below 0.1 rad/sec.
    \item [(b)] gain less than 0.04 from input n to output y for frequencies above 200 rad/sec. 
\end{itemize}
Translate the above specifications into requirements on the loop gain $|L(j \omega)|$ where loop gain is given by $L(s)=K(s) G(s)$.\\

    \item[(b)] a) $|L(j\omega)| \leq 99$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$ b) $|L(j\omega)| \geq 0.04$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$ 
    \item[(c)] a) $|L(j\omega)| \leq 0.04$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$ b) $|L(j\omega)| \geq 99$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$ 
    \item[(d)] a) $|L(j\omega)| \geq 0.04$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$ b) $|L(j\omega)| \leq 99$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$ 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Correct answer is (a).\\
The transfer function from $r$ to $e$ is $S(s) =\frac{1}{1 + L(s)}$. The steady error due to a
unit step reference input $r(t) = \bar{r}$ is given by $e = S(0) \bar{r}$. Thus specification (a) is equivalent to $|S(j\omega)| \leq 0.01$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$. This is approximately equivalent to $|L(j\omega)| \geq 99$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$.

The transfer function from $n$ to $y$ is $-T(s) =\frac{-L(s)}{1+L(s)}$. Specification (b) corresponds to $|T(j\omega)| \leq 0.04$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$ and this is approximately equivalent to $|L(j\omega)| \leq 0.04$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$.

\subsection{Proportional Controller}

A model for a DC motor is:
$$J \dot{y} + by = c V $$
where $y$ is the angular velocity of the motor shaft (deg/sec), and V is the input voltage (Volts).
The model parameters are: $J=3$ N m sec2/deg2 , $b=5$ Nm sec/deg, and gain from input voltage to applied torque $c=12$ Nm/Volts. We plan to design a controller $K(s)$ for this system. The controller and the system are in standard unity feedback setting. Let $e=r-y$ where $r$ is the reference signal. Let $n$ represent the output noise i.e. if $n \neq 0$ then $e=r-(y+n)$. Design a a proportional control law $K(s) = K_p$ so that the closed loop is stable and has gain less than 0.01 from reference $r$ to error $e$ for frequencies below 0.1 rad/sec.
    
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Firstly, we can show that the requirement of gain less than 0.01 from reference $r$ to error $e$ for frequencies below 0.1 rad/sec translates to $|L(j \omega)|=|K(j \omega) G(j \omega)| \geq 100$ for $\omega \leq 0.1 \frac{rad}{sec}$. The system transfer function is $G(s) =\frac{12}{3s + 5}$. This has a corner frequency at  $\omega=1.6$ rad/sec and DC gain $G(0) = 2.4$. Thus $K_p =\frac{100}{2.4}$ will ensure the gain requirement is approximately satisfied. Additionally, we can verify the closed loop pole of the system with $K_p =\frac{100}{2.4}$ is in the LHP so the closed loop system is stable. Thus both the requirements are met.

\subsection{Proportional Controller}

We plan to design a controller $K(s) = K_p$ for a system with transfer function $G(s)$ given by:
\[
G(s) = \frac{12}{3s + 5}
\]
The controller and the system are in standard unity feedback setting. Let $e=r-y$ where $r$ and $y$ representing the reference and the output signals respectively. Let $n$ represent the output noise i.e. if $n \neq 0$ then $e=r- (y+n)$. The specification is to design a controller so that the closed loop is stable and has gain less than 0.04 from input n to output y for frequencies above 200 rad/sec. What is the cross-over frequency. 
 
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
Firstly, we can show that the requirement of gain less than 0.04 from input $n$ to output $y$ for frequencies greater then 200 rad/sec translates to $|L(j \omega)|=|K(j \omega) G(j \omega)| \leq 0.04$ for $\omega \geq 200 \frac{rad}{sec}$. Thus $K_p \leq \frac{0.04}{|G(j200)|} \approx 2$ will ensure this requirement. Additionally, we can verify the closed loop pole of the system with $\frac{-5}{12}<K_p$ is in the LHP so the closed loop system is stable. Thus choosing \(K_p = 2\) meet the both requirements.  

The cross-over frequency is approximately 7.82 rad/sec.\\
\clearpage

\subsection{Design a Stable Controller}

Given a system's transfer function $G(s) =\frac{12}{3s + 5} $, use loop-shaping procedure to design a controller $K(s)$ such that the closed loop system is stable and it satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] has a loop crossover frequency near 20 rad/sec.
    \item [(b)] gain less than 0.01 from reference r to error e for frequencies below 0.1 rad/sec.
    \item [(c)] gain less than 0.04 from input n to output y for frequencies above 200 rad/sec. 
\end{itemize}
Verify that the closed-loop is stable with your control design.

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Solution :}} \\
We can use a proportional gain to set the loop cross-over frequency (requirement (a)). Then use an integral boost and roll-off to satisfy requirements (b) and (c) respectively. This may require some iteration to get values that meet all design specifications.

First we choose the proportional gain so that the loop gain has crossover $|L(j\omega_c)| =|K(j \omega_c) G(j \omega_c)| = 1$ at $\omega_c = 20$ rad/sec. This can be done with the gain $K_1 = \frac{1}{|G(j\omega_c)|} \approx 5.02$. This will give the first loop-shape $L_1(s) = G(s)K_1$. The first loop shape has DC gain $L_1(s) = K_1 G(s)$. Thus we need to increase the gain by a factor of $\frac{100}{12} = 8.4$ to ensure that we satisfy requirement (b). We'll use an integral boost 
$K_2(s) =\frac{s+\bar{\omega}_2}{s}$ where $\bar{\omega}_2$ is the frequency below which the gain starts to increase. With some iteration the choice $\bar{\omega}_2=5$rad/sec seem to easily exceed the low frequency requirement. Notice that $\bar{\omega}_2 < \omega_c$. For stability and robustness reasons we need the slope
of $|L|$ to be shallow near $\omega_c$. Thus we need to choose our low-frequency boost to start
sufficiently below $\omega_c$ that it doesn't have a significant impact on the slope at $\omega_c$. After
this stage our controller is $K_1 K_2(s)$ and our loop-shape is $L_2(s) = K_1 K_2(s)G(s)$.
Finally, we need to modify the loop shape to satisfy the design requirement iv. We can
choose a roll-off to decrease the high frequency gain $K_3(s) =\frac{\bar{\omega}_3}{s+\bar{\omega}_3}$. Again, we want to choose $\bar{\omega}_3 > \omega_c$ so that the roll-off has negligible effect on the slope of $|L|$ near cross-over. However, we also want to choose $\bar{\omega}_3$ small enough that we decrease the high frequency gain enough to satisfy $|L(j200)| \leq  0.0385$. After some trial and error $\bar{\omega}_3= 80$ rad/sec ensures that the requirements are satisfied. Our final controller is
$K(s) = K_1K_2(s)K_3(s)$ and our final loop-shape is $L_2(s) = K(s)G(s)$. The Bode plot and step responses are shown below. The step response has a small steady state error and good noise rejection. The response also has a small overshoot.
